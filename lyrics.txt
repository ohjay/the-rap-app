(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
> Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will serve you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?


(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right


(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right
Aw Yeah

How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself "why do you hurt me?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know that you love me baby
Time to take you away from me...
Only over my dead body...


I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Mmm, mmm
F*ck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some 
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from

Yeah, you know me well nigga, yeah 
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the p-ssy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yea
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again 
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine 
And I be hearing sh*t you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yea
It's been that way from the beginning I just been playing, I aint even notice that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright


I know, I know that you love me baby
The time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body


You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And f-ck you to the niggas that thinks it's there time, yea
Don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever gave you a star boy
Or you wanna be a mother fuckin' funny guy
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart boy
Yea, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel now more than ever
My city love me like I'm Mac Dre in The Bay
Second Album I'm pack paving away
The backpackers are back on the band wagon like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby's mom last night
We took a picture Last night
I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And lost everything that I came with
Yea, feel like I've been here before
I still got 10 years to go, ha
And this is the only sound you should fear
And these kids where crowns over here & everything is alright...

You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you're the f-cking coldest
Intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

Well aren't you a breath of fresh air
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they aint got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking somes d-cks until some millions appear
Voila! you do it right he might just buy you a car
Unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre
Independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer
Make it rain finger (check)
M3 beamer (check)
Champagne range
Triple white Caddy
Closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and BeBe
Ya don't need it greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who f-ck for bowls of baked ziti

Go, go, go, go, go, go

Go, go, go, go, go, go
As we proceed.


Uh, 5 and a half in boys
Ass is off the hook
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never
But never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever
You just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas
And enough money to loan us a little something extra
Should we ever need it
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it

It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
Last name ever 
First name greatest 
Like a sprained ankle boy ainâ€™t nothing to play with 
It started off local but thanks to all the haters 
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis 
And your city faded off to brown, Nino 
She insists she got more class, we know 
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo 
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo 
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album 
Whoâ€™d have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome 
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm 
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one 
Yeah nigga Iâ€™m about my business 
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list 
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness 
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness 
Bitches 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
I used to have hood dreams 
Big fame, big chains 
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came 
I went hard all fall like the ball teams 
Just so I can make it rain all spring 
Yâ€™all seen my story my glory 
I had raped the game young 
You can call it statutory 
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me 
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin 
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin 
You would think I ran the world like Michelleâ€™s husband 
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnâ€™t 
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnâ€™t 
Youâ€™re such a fucking loser 
He didnâ€™t even go to class Bueller 
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back 
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack 
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac 
All the way in Hollywood and I canâ€™t even act 
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap 
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
Ok, hello it's da Martian 
Space jam Jordanâ€™s 
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden 
Fresher than the harvest 
Step up to the target 
If I had one guess than I guess Iâ€™m just New Orleans 
And I will never stop like Iâ€™m running from the cops 
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top 
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops 
But what should I scream for this is my theme park 
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark 
Pistol on my side you donâ€™t wanna hear that thing talk 
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention 
Lil Wayne thatâ€™s what they got to say or mention 
Iâ€™m like Nevada in the middle of the summer 
Iâ€™m resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover 
Shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas 
No brake pads, no such thing as last 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
There they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow 
Nuts they go, macadamia they go so ballistic, whoa 
We can make them look like Bosoâ€™s 
Heâ€™s wondering if he should spit this slow 
Fuck no! Go for broke 
His cup just runneth over, oh no 
He ainâ€™t had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed 
Theyâ€™ve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose 
Back into the game and they know 
Rap will never be the same as before 
Bashing in the brains of these hoes 
And establishing a name as he goes 
The passion and the flame is ignited 
You canâ€™t put it out once we light it 
This shit is exactly what the fuck that Iâ€™m talking about when we riot 
You dealinâ€™ with a few true villains 
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillinâ€™ 
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths 
Now rewind it! 
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me, so howâ€™s it taste? 
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place 
Iâ€™m Hannibal Lecter so just in case youâ€™re thinking of saving face 
You ainâ€™t gonna have no face to save by the time Iâ€™m through with this place 
So Drakeâ€¦ 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man

byy: chelsey baybayy!!


Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn’t everything
I’m having a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that i'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time 
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well never mind,
I I I tried to told you, drizzy still ain’t nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cars saying fuck ya life
Okay now we outta here
Toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up
I got the voodoo for you bitches
I’m busy getting rich, I don’t want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double
Famous like a drug that I've taken too much
I never ever trip
Just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

Man I love my team. Man I love my team..
I would die for these niggas..


Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her Imma get her
I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mix tape?
That was just a keepsake
Bought the president the Louie presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks I ain’t talking about the peach state
Man for Petes sake scratch that, sweep stakes
(hahahaha)
Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you like no
I’m a bad bitch I ain’t never been a mixed breed.
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed
M M M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
But I collect 100 thou at the venue
And pop bottles with my team young money til the death of me


I'm about whatever man..
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it

Whole crews in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team. Man I love my team..

I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost


I’ve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn’t change
And I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? please don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours we both know
We know, they don’t get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste,ah
Pushing me away so I give her space,ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
I’ll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don’t know
Trying to run from that, say you’re done with that
On your face girl, it just don’t show
When you’re ready, just say you’re ready
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
And the party's over, just don’t forget me
We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won’t ever have to worry,
You won’t ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes


Cause if you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost


Yeah
It’s my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can’t deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don’t say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you’re following your heart
Cause your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know, you hate being alone
You ain’t the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin’ to save you
Instead they say,
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true


I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost 

Hol it, Hol it, Hol it, Hol it, Hol it
Y'all sleepin' in the streets
Shaky warrior
Yeah, this that Oliver 40, Niko shit man, 15 Fort York shit ya know
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?

Yeah, yeah
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari then I swerve
I want that Bugatti just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me I guess I know myself
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that
My city too turnt up I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbraud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
That's when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man I'm talkin' way before hashtags

I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes

Yeah, and you know how that shit go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women

So take me as I am I have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that parade love me
I’m a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for trinity Chris word
See my role models role with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough then the whole lotto
 So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mamoses with the clique quad
What up Nikko Jordan Lucky and TJ nicknamed the night fox clique we take it easy
You prime ministers claim you repping the team I need a mother fucking president to represent me


I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25 sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?


One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt?
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

 



Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh-t
When I hear talkin, I just dont know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams who Im racing with
You can see Im pacin it so that Im always chasin it
Wayne put me right here, thats who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own, but its lookin like July 4th
But I just wish theyd let you try it first
This time Im really goin off, fireworks



When I go off like July 4th
feels like a fire, Got to go higher
Its your revelation, my sweet celebration
light me like a rocket, cause can't nothing stop it
all I see is fireworks,
all i see is fireworks
every night its fireworks
every night its fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off like fireworks


I got this one girl, you know, in my life
so I say in this song, I say
I'm just such a gentleman
you should give it up for me
look at how I'm placing al my napkins and my cutlery
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you f-ck with me
who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me
yeh, I kept my wits about me luckilly
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
and you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
but I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
what an experience
you coulda been the one but it wasnt that serious
their was smoke in the air before now its me cleaing it
that felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
now I can see it in her eyes
Fireworks!

 


Everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that I still listen
and he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my Realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city I let her explore
ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close
yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first, that's why I'm really going off, Fireworks!



We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same

Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that noila got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way
Money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'on't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'mma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D, I'm the holy one
Yeaaah, you know wassup
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong


I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdose on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it,(aye) please don't do it,(aye) cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,


Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind.
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize it happened over time
She says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you suppose to do
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions.
You know the game even got it like that.
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that.
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind (mind, mind, mind)
Tell em' I apologize it happened over time (time, time, time)
They know

Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who"
And she like, "who are we kidding? You're 27, you just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me ,momma
What more they want from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough
Ir making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life


Yeah, uh-huh


Uh, hardly home but always reppin,
You hardly on and always second,
When I'm awake you always restin,
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question,
I, I'm doin classic shit in all my sessions,
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin,
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions,
I just always did my own thing,
Now I run the game, you stupid muddasuckas
I see all this money through my ohio state buck eyes,
Shippin goin good, but good can turn to better,
Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
come on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
come on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Yeah, wrong way down the one way,
Women don't get saved round me even on a sunday,
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who,
Then they meet my pop and tell 'I'm ''Drake is just a younger you'',
And shawty wanna party so don't let yo girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ, of me givin her mouth-to-mouth,
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her,
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcom X an Martin Luther
I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady,
They just loose to love, those are tennis games lady,
Have you countin money goin dufflebag-crazy,
Sippin on Pink Floyd an puffin Wayne Brady,
Damn, who's line is it anyways,
I'm in the daze, you been amazed, y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage,
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze,
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right,
You look nice, and yo frame, makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well alright, guess I might, know what fuck it yes I will,
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin less than real
Put it to you right


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
come on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest,
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused,
The gangstas recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's,
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus,
Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this ibomb, I palm
The game like it's a spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great mike,
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this gon be a great night,
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white,
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,
This that major moment you've been waitin on for too long,
The best that ever did it an doin it on a new song,
UGK an Young Money too strong
Down in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city

I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well

Okay, now you're talking my language

Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well

Swag on head to feet nigga
Stunt nigga
I might just bring in some girls from Miami

I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy


Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal


Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, "Baby girl, fall in line, " ok
Made a million, off of denim
Fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "I'll nigga alert! I'll nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)




I touched down in '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with' us and we don't fuck with' y'all, it's no different over on this side
God damn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, "You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help"
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,
Ya'll keep talking 'bout who next,
But I'm about how big as it gets,
I swear ya'll just wastin' ya'll breath,
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,
I'm a make it last forever,
It's not your time 'cause I ain't done yet,
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,
I was made for all of this shit,
And I'm on the road box office sales,
I'm getting paid for all of this shit,
Ask you to please excuse my table manners,
I was making room for the table dancers,
'Cause if we judging off your advances,
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!




HOE, SHUT THE fuck UP
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rest do
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythang
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit
Good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth
Drink a fifth
Load the nine
Leave you split, in the half
Smoke a half, Need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me
And I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'
Lil' bitch


Oh Me. Oh Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that, that ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)
I'm blessed than a motherfucker,
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin' nervous, clutchin' they chests like a motherfucker,
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail,
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man,
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do. 

:
I got friends with money and i got money too
so we put it together
and let you pick what to do it and then we do that
I got friends with money and i got money too
so we put it together
and let you pick what to do it and then we do that

1st verse: 
Focus on women then you get less done
Its like work flow its heavy like a wet sponge
Im gettin rich caue i think being broke is less fun 
Celebratin fathers day everyday so dont get son
Where you tryna go im ready
Pick any place in the world the doe is comin in steady
im chillen out with T and J and nico
my city aint a city that support they own people 
but i run it you say something about it, i doubt it
I got this gucci wallet i do not leave home without it
Im bout it , im bout it
im standing in on these concerts saying bring these booth with bottle no we do not need to stop it biii-ttt-ch
part of me that was rude
if you just started balling i say im bout to conclude

I got friends with money and i got money too
so we put it together
and let you pick what to do it and then we do that
I got friends with money and i got money too
so we put it together
and let you pick what to do it and then we do that

2nd verse:

and im callin your bluff

the stars on my team but i lead the league in asist
never been a beliver that previoiusly exist
I wonder what i be doin when prevously is this

right across from lindsy lohan

so we put it together
and let you pick what to do it and then we do that
I got friends with money and i got money too
so we put it together
and let you pick what to do it and then we do that


Worst...


Mothafucka never loved us, fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now, still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions, nigga we don't know shit
Flexing! Nigga, I'm just flexing
Nigga never loved us, do it look like we stressing?
Look at you, look at you and look at you, aww, I'm glad that they chose us
Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish, just to see if I'm finished


On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us... Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up?
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior


Hold up, hold my phone, mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us, now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us, so everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up! You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B




Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothing changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm coming back on my worst behavior


Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior


Things been so crazy and hected
I should of have got back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better any how...


So if you gotta go
If there's anythin I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you looking for a purpose


You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm all singing karaoke, further than I ever been


So if you gotta go...
If there's anyway I can help


Isn't it ironic,
That the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
And tell's me my life is to much and moves to atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you would choose some where that had somebody that you know
I'm alway's up to late
I worry bout you there alone in a place you call your home warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy cause no man wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest but the first cut is the deepest
I tryed to keep us together you was busy keeping secrets
Secrets you would tell everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money
I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm suprise you couldn't tell


I was only trying to get ahead 
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And your looking for a purpose


I was only trying to get ahead 
But the spotlight makes you nervous...


Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause


They loving the crew


Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'mma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know




Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
(If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city)
TRACK 4 ON TAKE CARE

You know a lotta girls be...thinking my songs about them, but
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...


Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say you da fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate,
Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the matt and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

Cause,



Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffin theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had

This sh-t was all I knew,
you and me only,
and I did it all for you,
still you were lonely,
we coulda worked it out,

uhh, but i guess things change,
its funny how someone elses success brings pain,
when ya no longer involved that person has it all,
and you just stuck standing there,

But, Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,
Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,


Yeah,
ever since Ive been long gone,
I traded in my senorita for a microphone,
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see,
your life is good but me and you its catastrophe,
if I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied,
I need a paramedic girl, Im feeling paralysed,
if I could choose, you will always be a friend to me,
the more money I made you acting like my enemy,
its crazy, I cant help it if you feel ashamed,
lots of pressure will turn you into my diamond babe,
how can something so familiar be so strange,
closest friends get estranged when the status change,
ahh, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at,
and my whole wild is the only one that had my back,
you were the perfect girl, now it seems we dont match,
is it the money, want me to give it back,




Uhh, i am the topic of conversation, this a celebration,
lets toast to the fact that I moved out my momma basement,
to a condo downtown because its all about location,
I sit and drink wine and watch californication of life,
you shoulda been here to kick it with me,
we coulda split this whole thing up 50/50,
but now im at the 40/40 getting b-tches tipsy,
killing sh-t the ever so talented Mr Ripley,
how I go from being the man that you argue with,
to me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest sh-t,
I should wanna go back to the one I started with,
but Im addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit,
yeah, just ask me how things are coming along,
you can tell me that you never heard none of my songs,
long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen,
cos whats a star when its most important fan is missing?

()

Let's get it, I can't wait to trick man
It's gonna be so sweet
Summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine

Still like, "Can you hit it with your OVO goose on?"
I'm like, "What are you on?"
Told me that she two on, ha, that's cute we a few on
I could show you what to do in this bitch
Take the addy with the water pop two and then sip
Me, you and your bitch
And we talkin' bout life, love too and this dick
First I had her in the six, then we had her in the six
You know I got another bar for ya
I'mma chill baby, we don't want the devil in this bitch, nah
Got a bad one we could call it Kelly Rowland
Oh she get the jelly rollin', Akinyele in the telly
Cause she open I could tell that she from Oakland
Pasadena, what up?

I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2

A nigga got a woosah, comin' at me never work no matter who try
I got 'em all a cheque without the woo-hah
Flip modes on ya quick got a few sides
Comin' from the 6 side
Where niggas goin' shower posse just to get by
Stay true never switch sides, yea, the game turn me into this guy
Yea, and now every time Drake out
Cameras always flashing tryna put me on the Takeout
Crib in Calabasas man I call that shit the safe house
Thirty minutes from L.A. the shit is way out
But these days that's where I'm stayin'
You can hear it in my voice I'm goin' way in
Yea, OB that my brother like a Wayans
Just know I only show up if you payin', nigga
Yea, I always been on, I always been too on
For like the past five years all these niggas wanna shine
I got the flashlight here man
Bout to hit the gas right here man
Old soul livin' in the past life here man
You, bring the cash right here man
Miracle, sit your ass right here man
Man, You know I hate to wait
That's why I get it first and you get it late
Yea, OVO sound that man that's everyday
It's Young Money Records get the record straight

I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2 on
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2

You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so bad girl, you're so awful
I fuck you right in my office
You go tell your friends you're honest
That's why all your friends are on
You know you made me a promise
We're not in this for commitment
Your man's gone and you don't miss him
Book you flights and confirmation
Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasing that paper
Even though you're exhausted you're still gonna make it girl
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so, you're so
You love to get 2 on

And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know that I put you on
And you know, that's something yo

That's what they doin', Cameron, they actin' like these singers, man.
I ain't goin' to the studio until I got a situation.
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer.
Who gonna be on the hook?
Man, what is you doin'?
Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!

Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though
Voice mail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, "nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, "the first mill gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work

Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)

Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man

Hear What?
Yo hear what, tek time
(Laughing)
Ahh, no shit!
Yo hear what?
Wa gwan ...
Yo him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van you know Drizzy

Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing

I do better with the rider in my system
Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we

YEAHH !!!


My name is drizzy
and i aint perfect
but i work hard
so i deserve it
and i belong
right where you see me
aint no offence about it
i aint mistah feeny
nah i got a decent set of manners
and a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
and i fall in love with girls caught up with superficial glamour
who dress like sarah jessica
and live like princess diana
so often they have addictions
and im the one that'll feed it
but truely you're bad enough that you dont even really need it
you can show up at the party on dirty public transit
and i guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin candids
of you and your posse partying
drinking watch you get handed
with your virgin island tans
all lookin like you just landed

Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker. Boys playin' Playstation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?

Yeah, sound sound sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this?
How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions
We ain't doing no interview

Yeah, yeah, oh, you gotta love it
Oh, you got, oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried
It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual, my career's like a "how to "manual
So I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we have words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to R.I.P. about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But man, oh, you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it

Boomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm... (Louuuu)
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work a night shift

Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift

Young, but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Louuuu)

If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I'm never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen, you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soul mate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you

She said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

These days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

She says kiss you like miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
ANd when you're fuckinq someone else
just fuck her like she aint me

Damn those words are scary
those words are scary virqin mary 
I just tell her to spare me
I was in 


I've been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? It can't be
They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
I promise to always give you me, the real me


Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go


Owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright life'd make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumbs could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do


Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Wait until the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)


I know way too many people here right now that I didn’t know last year
who the fuck are y’all
I swear it feels like the last few nights we’ve been everywhere and back
but I just can’t remember it all
what am I doing, what am I doing
oh yeah that's right, I’m doing me, I’m doing me
I’m living life right now man
and this what I’m do til its over
til it’s over, it’s far from over


alright, bottles on me
long as I’m a drink it
never drop the ball, fuck y’all thinking
making sure the young money ship is never sinking
bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldn’t have drove, tell me how I’m getting home
you too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I’ve ever known
got to go thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
all I need is a fucking red jackets with some zippers
super good smiddoke a package of the swishas
I did it over night, it couldn’t happen any quicker
y’all know them, but fuck it me either
but point the biggest skeptic out I’ll make them a believer
it wouldn’t be the first time I’ve done it throwing hundreds
when I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ahh,




Uhhh,
one thing 'bout music when it hits you feel no pain
and I swear I got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
so they tell me that they love me I know better than that it’s just game
it’s just what comes with the flame
and I’m ready for that I’m just saying
but I really can’t complain, everything is kosher
two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
I really can’t see the end getting any closer
but I’ll probably still be the man when everything is over
so I’m riding through the city with my high beams on
can you see me can you see me get your visine on
y’all just do not fit the picture
turn your widespread on
if you thinking Imma quit before I die dream on
man they treat me like a legend
am I really this cold
I’m really too young to be felling this old
it’s about time you admit it who you kidding man
nobody’s ever done it like I did it
ahh
(chorus)

Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again
Soon as you get in

CHORUS (1x):


END!!!

Here I go. Im a rapper turned singer. And you can tell that he smoke, but I don't need my vocal cords all I hit is C-Notes.
N.E.R.D flow, i spaz if im prevoked
I'm about to change the fuckin game, pass the re-mote.
Money is everythang, and its every other thing.
I'm part of the choir, its the motto that my brotha sang.
Cash is the right now, women are the post game.
Money-over-bitches dot com check the domain.
It's comin too soon, album on the way.
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon.
Oops I mean a red moon... I did it again to 'em.
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation.
I say, heavy metaphors, flow so over weight.
I can rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake.
Frost bite drizzy nigga, no body as cold as Drake.
Keep yo ass in-line, don't be tryin to roller skate.
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit.
I am twenty-one tell me who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real cause I'm getting hood lovin I ain't even talkin' street shit.
Young angel, young lyin and I'm done tryin.
I'm just doin, who's drinkin cause I'm buyin.
It's on meee, everything is on meee.
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin john B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet.
This is for all the stripper cause I know that they gonna bump it tellem back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it.
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear.
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year.
Text brackets and back and forth faxes
My money comin full circle, get up on my axis.
Maybe Imma kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest.
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles and a booth.
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience cause I want it to make sense.

White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness. DRAKE!

Wayne: Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes. And they might even say you should leave me alone.
Homie scared. Cause they just like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy.
Just like Shaggy I toat dat boom bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck bout ya'll
I ain't talkin moths but you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm falling but up I fall and if ya bitch in heat she can fuck my dog.
I went from penny pinchin to private planes.
Never sat on any benches, I got in games.
Starter carter ball harder, ten girls penthouse suit ya'll order.
Whatever ya'll please. wine crackers and cheese.
They take off their clothes and put on my t's.
This supplement im on got me feeling mighty
My gun and money don't split call that shit Siamese.
My watch make the frickin' time freeze.
Yah girl bless me she suck my dick when I sneeze.
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need.
And eighteen G's is why the chicken cross the street.
Whatchya know about it my niggas so about it.
If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it.
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer.
Got the shoty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me.
Im a bad boy obviously, pop one at your ivy league
I dont have a rivalry if so you will have a casualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually.
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering.
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery.
You got short salary, and I got long money, I got cash money, I got young money. bitch...

Lyrics © Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group


Uh
I’m just so far gone
October’s own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screaming in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on
Where did we go wrong
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game
And its one I can’t post pone
Meaning if it rains
I’m the one its raining on
With my diamond chain’s on
Still nothing setting stone
Women borrow sweaters
That I spray with my cologne
And tell me don’t forget them
And I promise that I won’t
Feeling so distant from everyone I’ve known
To make everybody happy
I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown
Parties that we’ve thrown
I done more for this city
Than these rappers that have blown
Its only been 3 years
Look at how I’ve grown
I’m just in my zone
I call this shit the calm

Yeah

But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom
And I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay
And it wont even take that long
You can see it in my face
Even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school
Its proven and its known
I’m sittin’ in a chair
But in the future, it’s a throne
I know you like to worry
It’d be better if you don’t
Cuz….


You know…
Everything gone be all right
I promise
I apologize to you know
Put y’all in this position
40 Mama always say
Don’t ask permission, just ask forgiveness you know
So uhh
Forgive me
Yeah


Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a vantage you can gain
They love it when you smile
Unaware that it’s a strain
It’s a curse you gotta live with
When you’re born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say you’re the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Terrence in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It’s a weight that’s on my chest
Who ever spottin’ me is playin’
So I’m liftin’ all alone
Trynin’ not to get a sprain
Hopin’ Western Junior doin’ currency exchange

Cuz my dad called
It got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like
I had a rolls and I went and got a range
And he payin’ for his cigarettes
With some dollars and some change
Yeah
And I can only feel his pain
Cuz in Memphis, Tennessee
There is only so much to attain
So I’m fillin’ out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me
I just hope he doesn’t say that shit in vain
I’m why your girls heart is in a slain
Call me Heartbreak Drake
I’m the hardest one to tame
As a man, I’m just honest
As an artist, I’m a king
With my own set of problems
That be sittin’ on my brain
Yeah
And see this is the thang
What they viewin’ as braggin’
Is the way that I maintain
The shit I write
While starin’ out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I remain

Me


Yeah…
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
That’s why I’m putting on
They always wanna ask what type of act that you putting on
Like…. Damn 


Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn’t be driving, it just got so much harder
Can’t even see straight, I can’t even see straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I’m the truth that’s right I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain’t gotta die to get to heaven
You Girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How’d I know, how’d I know? That’s me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you asking me my where-abouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rappin’ bitches, rappin’ bitches bitches
And rappin’ rappin’ an’ bitches until all of us switches
I swear, it’s been two years since somebody ask me who I was
I’m the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
That’s whats important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing “walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I’m a uptown nigga, ah”
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways


People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)


Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon’ tell me that she don’t dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that’s all I’m really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin’ furs like its snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that’s the shit that she like
So why am I a classic, this is who I’m trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turnin’ papers in won’t get me paid
If I don’t nothing I’mma ball
I’m countin all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah I need that, making major changes to the life I’m living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways



People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)

Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do


All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting, I told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

 

Hello
Yeah I just walked in
Yeah I'm good you still working?
Tonight, right now?
'Did I go out' yeah I went out
I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed
Shit... wine or water
You said something about a cold drink
I don't know, I'm delirious... night


Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy

But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
"F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing thats so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say

F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin' 'bout bitches
That we almost had
I don't think I'm concious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeh we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeh, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women thats living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on


Well I'm sorry" -- Drake
Are you drunk right now? -- Woman

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me


You're not going to come?
Guess i'm bout to just kick it here then...

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Drizzy,
Oh yeah Trey I fucking feel you,
They be staring at the money like it's unfamiliar,
I get it,
I live it,
To me there's nothings realer,
Just enough to solve your problems,
Too much would kill ya,
And when I leave,
I always come right back here,
The young spit it and everybody in rap fear,
A lot of ya'll still sounding like last year,
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier,
Nickels for my thoughts,
Dimes in my bed,
Quarters of the kush,
Ain't the limes in my head,
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD,
Yeah,
I want it all,
That's why I strive for it,
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it,
I know what's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Yeah,
I want things to go my way,
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,
And my mother tried to runaway from home,
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway,
And she cried to me so I cried too,
And my stomach was soaking wet,
She only 5'2,
And 48 hours all before I showed up,
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
Damn my reality just set in,
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
I do a lot of things,
Hoping I never have to fit in,
So trying to keep up with my programs is like a dead end,
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
And life change for us every single week,
So what's good,
But I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Wise words from a decent man,
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand,
This lost boy got fly without peter pan,
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,
In person I am everything and more,
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,
Just call me shop and bag drizzy,
And call me Mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy,
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad,
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
To big homie use a flash if you must,
And I swear I ain't asking for much
All I want is


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

It's like I know what I got to say,
I just don't know how to say it to you


Pardon the swag,
But bitches cartate,
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,
How come I can't,
Miss a woman like I can't miss cartdates,
Cheese,
But shes not in this portrait,
Life's fine but I don not portray,
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
I don't want the glow,
I want the glow ray,
And I'm a fuck the world,
But this is just foreplay,
Tired of hearing bullshit,
Bring her on to cowshit,
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than ? shit,
That's word to toronto,
So high up I got birds in the condo,
Ain't that a female dog,
Ask her who I am to her,
And she yell god,
Weezy baby go ? hard,
No further details boy.

Drake] 
I am on a 24 hour champagne diet 
Spillin while im sippin it 
I Encourage you to try it 
Im probably just saying that cause i dont have to buy it 
The club owner supply it 
Boy im on that fly shit 
I am what everybody in my past dont want me to be 
Guess what i made it 
Im the muthaf-cking man 
I just want you to see,come take a look 
Get a load of this n-gga 
Quit frontin on me 
Dont come around and try come gas me up 
I like runnin on E 
I, I, I, 
Im on my Disney shit goofy flow 
On records im captain hook and my new car is roofio 
Damn 
Where my roof just go 
Im somebody that you should know 
Get to shakin somethin cus thats what Drumma produced it for 
Yes i make mistakes that i dont ever make excuses for 
Like leavin' girls that love me and Constantly seducing hoes 
Im losing my thoughts i say damn 
Where my roof just go? 
Top slipped off like Janet at the super bowl, 
I got em 

 
they cant help it, and I cant blame em 
Since I got famous but b-tch, I got money to blow 
Im gettin it in, letting these bills fall 
All over your skin 
Got money to blow oh oh oh oh 

 
Richer than the richest 
We certified gettin it CM YM Cash Money business 
Higher than the ceiling fly like a bird, hit the gucci store 
And later get served 
We smoked out with no roof on it 
Them people passin so we smash on them 
Ballin out we keep the cash on deck 
Lamborghini and the Bentleys on the V-set 
Louie lens iced out with the black diamonds 
Car of the year Ferrari the new Spider 
No lie im higher than i ever been 
Born rich born uptown born to win 
Fully loaded automatic 6 Benz 
Candy paint foreign lights with my b-tch in 
Born hustlin too big n-gga to strive me up 
Cant stop me more money burn em up 

 

 
When I get paid every 24 hours money and the power 
Come to VIP and get a Champagne Shower 
I dont have to worry because everything ours, 
and I got a big bouquet of Mary Janes Flowers 
That kush I promise Thats My Dude 
But we dont smoke that Reggie Bush 
And Im with two women make you take a second look 
We poppin like Champagne Bottles But We Never Shook 
and We Goin Be Alright If We Put Drake On Every Hook

Yeah
I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time, like
What it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then, but
I can probably tell you a lil somethin' now


Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin', I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels and they silencin' you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here
I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch chrome green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years
It's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap
It's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' dranks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like (vocalizes)
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring 07
Second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is whack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at the dinner table and say "my baby's famous and I knew it"

And it wasn't nothin' to it
I'm drawin' and drawin' till the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out


Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF


Closer to my dreams (Miss Andreena Mill)
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah (Yeah man)
I feel it in my sleep (Sing it to 'em baby)
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams


Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progress
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video has made everything right with ex (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Too many rappers and not enough-
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
They can't
Play pen drop out
The gray ten drop out
Summer 05 with the gray Benz drop out
Charcoal charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the awful dodger
Showed her I'mma
I told her I'mma
Bout to get my run-on so hold the commas
Times changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home



Closer to my dreams 
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah 
I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks
Hit me when you done your shift
Wooh, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what?
I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky
I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me
Someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-the-strippin-shit"
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me
I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect
She's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog

Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift
I need some company
I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company

Mo City trip! Mo City trip right now!
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
A Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now

It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
Tour 'round the city, it's the shit right now
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Pop a couple percs let's get it in right now
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now
Call up your girl and put them heels on
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now
I'm on a Mo City trip
I'm a dog
I'ma dog, I'm in heat baby...heat baby
I'm a dog.....
I go ham, I'm a hog
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off
What she get in to, when we take it off
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions
Do you mind if we just menage just a little?

Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now


It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya
See ya picture, now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya


Yeah, one time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch


I'm so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need


I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Air Force stunting flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that muthafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on


I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Takin' everything slow, so slow, so slow but I do it to her


Drapped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end


Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rollin' through the city
Bumpin' that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like everything just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone

Uh,
I'm just so far gone, 
October's own, 
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong,
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown,
parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne

You know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A
Pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
You know, so... forgive me
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

Uh,
And life is so insane, 
Look what I've became, 
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why yo girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain

Me, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man.




(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
> Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will serve you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?


(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right


(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right
Aw Yeah

Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit ain’t my fault, girl cause I'm lonely

Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody’s house that you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it, I’m not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae

This shit ain’t my fault

falling for her like how safe is gravity
I'll make your girl about face and marry me
hahahaha, yeh

but ahhh, the things I'm willing to do for her
I wish I could have a threesome with two of her
I would sing a love song if I knew the words
but I'll be damned if another nigga do it first
cos you the one, damn I think I see the sun
I guess that mean you gotta run
well holla at me when you done


Can I dig it
when you baby
woop woop woop
my darling baby


uhh
she nothing like every other dime
I think about her and couple things come to mind
thoughts like if she end up my baby mother fine
cos we only use a rubber like every other time
oooh, I bet she so embarrassed
I had to take her ass to Paris
give her the moments that she cherish
you know


yep
she got it coming to her like an heiress
and anything she want I +wheel+ like +ferris+
oops I meant ferris and in the coupe I tint very light
so them hating bitches can see me and you at every light
oooh, and I hope its one of them long lights
I mean I hope its one of them long nights
no wrong turns, aint no such things as a wrong right


uh yeah
you make me feel so good
and every time we cut I swear it heals so good
its been over a year that shit is still so good
no adjusting for you, you know just what to do and all
yea, oh and I love it
see I'm trying to make it public
I think the glass slipper does fit


and yesterday I told her she a muthafucker
and how her new haircut is so becoming of her
oh thats your girl, well Imma make a women of her
never do to another what we do one another
now thats a numbers for ya, and i'll give up my summers for ya
yeah I'll spend my winters and my springs on it
and put a ring on it, eyy




uhh, just say yes not no
the club is overrated baby lets not go
lets stay home and burn a couple calories
fuck the house up and make the maid earn a salary
yeah I cook you dinner if you cook me breakfast
they say that nobodies perfect but you look perfected
I really love to be the one you took a step with
so trust me when I tell you it'd be worth the effort


shes unbelievable like a purple leopard (?)
just give me the formula watch me work the method
hehe, Weezy F, I prefer the best shit
and babe you the fucking best
you deserve a trophy
you could be my four leaf clover
my clothes aren't tight nigga their cosy
and when she turn around they say Whoa like Joey
thats my baby
and I love it
yeah, Young Money


How did I end up right here with you
after all the things that I been through
its been one of those days
you tryin’ forget about
take a shot and let it out
let’s get right
now that I’m here baby...


show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
show me a good

show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)


I live for the nights that I can’t remember,
with the people that I won’t forget
spending all the money I just work my ass off
for the things that I won’t regret
I’ve been waiting way too long long long long
tellin’ everybody that I know we about to be on on on on
I ain’t tryin’ look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with
that’s my team, never would I let a woman come between
what we doing right now
this our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream
I’m the Osirus of the shit right now
go to guy for the hits right now
whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now
if you can’t hold your liquor you better quit right now





How ’bout you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed
make the most out of tonight and worry bout it all tomorrow
understand girl, we fam girl
can’t get me right and I do Wayne
Cash money young money pop champagne
Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
people really hate when a backpack rapper get rich
and start livin’ that life dawg
feels like when you gettin’ to that paper hip hop hates ya
they would do it just like I do if they could
its in our nature
ahh, young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer
I came up in the underground though
so I’ma spend another ten thousand for Dilla
call me over rated or creative or too jaded
because any way you put it bitch I made it, YUP




{verse 1}
all niqht i've, been starin'
can you tell i want you ?
can't be too, wide open
but there's nothin, i won't do
ohhh... just want  you to know

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

{verse 2}
I wish i... wasn't famous
I wish i... was still in school
So that i can have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you crazy

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

It may not mean nothing to yall
but understand nothing was done for me
so I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
Im shutting shit down at the mall
and telling that girl she the one for me
and I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine


Last name ever 
first name greatest
like a sprained ankle boy I aint nothin to play with
it started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
and your city faded off to brown, Nino
she insists she got more class, we know!
swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
if you was at the club you know i bald, Kimo
drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
who'd have thought a country rock tour would be the outcome
labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
everybody got a deal, I did it without one
yeah nigga im about my business
killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
if you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness
bitches

I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine


I used to have hood dreams
big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
just so I can make it rain all spring
yall seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
you can call it statutory
when a nigga blow up they can build statues of me
old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin
now superbad chicks giving me macLovin
you would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
you would think these niggas know me when they really doesnt
like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnt
you're such a fucking loser
you need to go to class Bueller
trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
remember she had a bad hip like a fanny pack
chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
all the way in Hollywood and i cant even act
they pull their cameras out and Goddamn they snap
I used to want this day forever yall can have it back

()
it may not mean nothing to yall

Ok, Hello its da martian
space jam jordans
I want this shit forever
wake up and smell the Garden
fresher than the harvest
step up to the target
if I had one guess than i guess im just New Orleans
and i will never stop like Im running from the cops
hop up in my car and tow my chauffeur to the top
life is like a fucking roller coaster then it drops
but what should i scream for this is my theme park
my mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
pistol on my side you dont wanna hear that thing talk
let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention
Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer
Im resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas
no brake pass no such thing as last

There they go, back in stadiums
as Shady spits his flow
nuts they go, macadamia they go so ballistic woah
we can make them look like bosos
he's wondering if he should spit his slow
fuck no go for broke
his cup just runneth over oh no
he aint had a robust like this since the last time he overdosed
they've been waiting patiently for Pinnochio to poke his nose
back into the game and they know
rap will never be the same as before
bashing in the brains of these hoes
and establishing a name as he goes
the passion and the flame is ignited
you cant put it out once we light it
this shit is exactly what the fuck im talking about when we riot
you dealin with a few true villains
whose stayin inside of the booth truth spillin
and spit true feelings, till our tooth fillings come flying
up out of our mouths
now rewind it
payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
when I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass
so loud that it shakes the place
Im hannibal lecter so just in case your thinking of saving face
you aint gonna have no face to save by the time im through with this place
so Drake

()
It may not mean nothing to yall
but understand nothing was done for me
so i dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine                                                  Im shutting shit down at the mall
and telling that girl she the one for me
and I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

This is why I do this shit.

I think they call this, uhm, venting.

 1:

Look
Uhh.

This is me.
Still the same.
They want the hits.
I play the game.
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.
It all comes spilling out like i hit a vein.
Watt up lil Braw.
Watt up slum Ville.
I hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still.
The fans thinking that we all signed for one meal.
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.
That aint how it works.
That aint that how it goes.
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.
And I could use a writer to balance out my flows.
But I never share my thoughts,
This is all a nigga knows.
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised.
And I would be performing just as long as Im alive.
So every word I utter will be mine.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
Oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

 2:
I never cried when Pac died.
But I probably will when Hov does.
And if my tears hold value, then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us.
And Ill be standing in a puddle.
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.
And ima keep it honest.
Am so tired of being subtle.
Its just me, Forty, O, and nich standing in a huddle.
Staring at the members of my team.
Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme.
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.
I hope you tell your family this shit aint what it seems.
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.
And know I pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions.
At least I put it all in the open.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

 3:
Look.
Fuck all yall.
We ignore feelin's here.
Premature millionaires.
Welcome to my realest year.
Yeah.
I swear we making a killah here.
I should be on top of the world here just chillen here.
Uh.
But its funny having fans.
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance, and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit dont feel the same.
Yeah.
And plus things are just so real at home
People think Ive changed just because my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere so im never actually am alone, i just always feel alone.
I think im scared of what the future holds.
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.
Every girl I meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes.
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
All my old friends think i got a new crowd.
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.
I guess that mean they come few and far between.
Even though am living out what you would call adream.
Yeah.
And my uncle aint even messaging me.
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.
I hope this isnt one of those forever things.
Its funny how money can change everything.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

I can make your bed rock

For her attractive ass
And now we murders

And she still shine
I hate to see her go
But I love to watch her leave
But I keep her runnin back and forth
Like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day
Hot as a summers eve
Young money thieves
Steal your heart with ease


I like the way you walkin
If your walkin my way

Now lets fly away
Lets buy a place
With all kinds of space
Ill let you be the judge
And Im the case

No Stevie wonder
She dont even wonder
Cuz she know she bad
And I got her n*gger
Grocery bag

I Love ya tosha roll
Hotter than wasabi

But I cant meet you in the lobby
Girl I gotta watch my back
Cuz Im not just anybody
I seen them stand in line
Just to get beside her
I let her see the aston
And let the rest surprise her
Thats when we disappear
You need GPS to find her
Oh that was your girl?
I thought I recognized her


Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me Mr. Flinestone
I can make your bed rock

Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the matt and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

Cause,



Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffin theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had

This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havn’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our seperate ways
So i’m single...
Thinking about what we had and missing you
But I aint santa, I got something for these bad b*tches too
I mean paprazzi on me trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthaf*ckin heart out, its drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me do I ever cross your mind
Because all this sh*t is new to me, i’m learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good
I know that n*ggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed
I promise to stay the same


I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest


(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me

(I'm doin my thing 3x)
I'm tryna be unforgettable...


This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say fo' life yall say fo'ever
Its hard but it's fair I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The names young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’m gon need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers

(?) so whats the deali young done everything in the A but f*ck chillin
So welcome to my life no two days the same
Like for yall to meet the love of my life her names the game


I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest


(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I'm doin my thing 3x)

Man, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving, yeah I'm leaving, yeah I'm leaving, I'm gone

No looking back when I'm gone
No looking back when I'm gone
No more (x16)

It's over, yeah it over, yeah I'm leaving, I'm gone
I've been doing this wrong, I've been here for too long
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit at home, I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid I'mma die before I get where I'm going
I know I'mma be alone
I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta hit a road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta know the road

Something is said, don't say that again
I just been out and bad from way back when

I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25 sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?


One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt?
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

 

You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

{verse 1}
all niqht i've, been starin'
can you tell i want you ?
can't be too, wide open
but there's nothin, i won't do
ohhh... just want  you to know

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

{verse 2}
I wish i... wasn't famous
I wish i... was still in school
So that i can have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you crazy

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious


{fadey fade away.... lls .}


I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure


How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9am in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?


Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas lookin' like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowin' that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's gettin' into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lackin' synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it’s meant to be
Paranoid, always rollin' with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man




Yesterday when we were getting high
you were invited, you woulda liked it
uh uh ah, I know you all too well
we said that we can kiss the past goodbye
but your weren't excited
there's no way to fight it
you can stay shawty but here I go


Should I spend the weekend in Vegas
I'm busy living the moment not taking pictures to save it
I mean how could I forget
my memories never faded I can't relate to these haters
my enemies never made it
I am... still here with who I started with
the game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr sh-t
carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship
yeah, I'm 23 with a money tree
growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist and thats how she met my pops
and now my garden is enormous, it's happening penny lane
I said its happening Penny Lane
just like you said I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead
uh ahh, thats word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough!


What am I afraid of
this is what dreams are supposed to made of
the people I don't have time to hang with
always look at me and say the same sh-t

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh



Am I wrong for making light of my situation
clap on when 40 got something for me to snap on
NOw that I'm on I dont want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on
get my f-cking buffett on
I heard they jsut moved my grandmother to a nursing home
and I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
but hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
that I barely know at all and
plus this women that I mess with unprotected txt us saying she wish she woulda kept it
the one I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
I couldn't tell you where the f-ck head is
I'm holding on by a thread its like I'm high right now
the guy right now and you can tell by looking at my eyes right now
that nothing really comes as a surprise right now
cause we having the time of our lives right now




I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
the other day Lissa told me she missed the old me
which made me question when I went missing
and when I start treating my friends different
maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the 2 guns in my face during the stick up
maybe cause I girl I f-cking trusted set the whole sh-t up
but a fact I have'nt seen 'em since they locked big Rich up
I know, the same time, I'm quick to forget
bout to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets
burn it al burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
cause half the itme I got it right I probably guessed
did I just trade free time for camera time
will I blow all of this money baby, hammertime
yeah, I just need some closure, aint no turning back for me
I'm in it till it's over


I said tell me whats really going on
Drizzy back up in this thing Im ready, whats happenin?
Gone for surgery but now Im back again
Im bout my paper like a muhfuckin scratch and win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake you got em right?) Yeah I got em Bun
I love myself because I swear their life is just not as fun
Neks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
yeah, Im in the city of the purple sprite
someone tell Maliah Im on fire she should work tonight
call up King of Diamonds and tell China itd be worth the flight
Ill be at my table stacking dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin twerk somethin basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin naked
I dont judge her, I dont judge her but I could never love her
Cause to her Im just a rapper and soon shell have met another
Thats why me and Lil Jazz bout to spaz can you keep up?
Im just feeling sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
and D.R.A.K.E. just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her Id admit it

And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy

Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit

Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it

Whole squad on that real shit

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'

Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

That's the shit I'm talking about though
Like you changed up
You don't even fucking link nobody no more
You just dash me away like a cyattie
Yo, you cheesed me dog

Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it’s dark out 
To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss ya
Shit’ll come back around and get ya
Crazy like all my niggas
Crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the BAR exam
I drove in the snow for you
You probably don’t remember half the shit a nigga did for you

Ya, you ain’t really fuck with me way back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
How bout now?
Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?

Always been daddy’s little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain’t even say thank you
I had no money
Left from back when I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like “who’s this?”
I be like “me, girl.”
You be like “oh word, true shit?”
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel I have it like that
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I’m not even Christian I still went to church that year
Guess, I just had to pretend that year
I ain’t even see my friends that year
Places that I should’ve been

You ain’t really fuck with me way back then
But how bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
How bout now?
Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?

Why do I feel so alone? 
Like everybody passing through the studio ,
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role ,
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know,
And I don't have the heart to give these, 
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go, 
So they stick around kicking out feedback, 
And I entertain it as if I need that, 
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that,
My privacy about the only thing I need back but, 
It's hard to think of them polite flows, 
Mr. Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes, 
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes, 
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed, 
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows, 
Life was so full, 
Now this shit just being lipo'd, 
Always said I'd say it all on the right track, 
But in this game you only lose when you fight back, 
Black diamond bracelets, 
Showing you the basics, 
I can't live and hold the camera, 
Someone gotta tape this, 
I make hits unlike a bitch, 
That's married I ain't miss, 
24 hours from greatness, 
I'm that close, 
Don't ever forget the moment, 
You began to doubt, 
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out, 
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South, 
Watchin' whole show, 
Embarrassed to pull my camera out, 
And my mother embarrassed, 
To pull my Phantom out, 
So I park about 5 houses down, 
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown, 
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around, 
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus, 
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness, 
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus, 
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless, 
And promoters try to get me out to they club, 
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how, 
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, 
Standing with my next girl, 
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now, 
And shit could get weird unless they all down, 
And so I stay clear.

We from a small town, 
Everybody talks and everybody listen, 
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing, 
I've always been something that these labels can't buy, 
Especially if they tryin' to take a peice of my sou,l 
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez "Damn Drake fly" 
And he just be like "Silly mother fucker I know" 
That was your bad, 
How could you pass up on 'em? 
He just take them records, 
And he gas up on 'em, 
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em, 
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em, 
Oh they did Po, 
At least they tried to, 
And that's what happens, 
When you spitting what's inside you, 
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video, 
And they think they can market you, 
However they decide to nahh, 
But Forty told me to do me, 
And don't listen to anybody that knew me, 
'Cause to have known me would, 
Mean that there's a new me, 
And if you think I changed in the slightest, 
Could of fooled me, 
Boy in my city I'm da 2-3, 
Drug dealers live vicariously through me, 
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy, 
I'm just not the social type, 

And campus life is crazy understand, 
I could get money with my eyes closed, 
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo, 
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll, 
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know, 
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will, 
I got new shit, 

I'm gettin' better still, 
Little niggas put my name in they verses, 
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal, 
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill, 
And I think this got this "Making of a Legend" feel, 
Problem with these other niggas they, 
Ain't never real, 
Yea ... that's all I can say.

I’m more than just an option
Hey, Hey, Hey
refuse to be forgotten
Hey, Hey, Hey
I took a chance with my heart
Hey, Hey, Hey
And I feel it taking over

I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I bet if i give all my love then

Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do


All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting, I told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

 

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone till November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house takin' no calls
I done hit the stride, got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the wri-wri-wri-wri

Rrrr Ting

I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy, get hurt, boy
Aww, here go another mo'fucker that don't understand
The concept of puttin' money first, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You too worried 'bout the bitches
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it
She'll admit it, she'll admit it
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy
Shit hot up in the 6 right now, shit hot up in the 6, boy
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now
Come see us and get it fixed, boy
Black Benz on the road, boy, already had a Rolls Royce
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys
I give a fuck about old boy
I give a fuck about his squad, boy
I give a fuck about your mob, boy
I'm the real 6 God, boy
I'm about to say a true thing
I'm about to say a true thing
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
God damn, you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this
I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now



It's not me and you
It's not me it's you
Your reckless and you know it
They don't love you like I do
Say you're moving over, like guess that's just the motion

I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

I don't have a fuck to give
I been moving state to state
In my leather and my Tims
Like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chubb
That's my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
That's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling
'Cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone

But, I guess that's just the motion
And your phone doesn't ring when they got everything
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

Yeah,
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
'Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her
And she know it
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help

But, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh) 

These girls aint got nothing on you
uhh, say baby I had to mention
that if you were a star youd be the one Im searching for
other girls they got attention

Its just what comes with the fame, and Im ready for that, Im just sayin
But I really cant complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin Ima quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
Im really too young to be feelin this old
Its about time you admit it, who you kiddin, man?
Man, nobodys never done it like I did it (Ugh)

:
I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last year, who the f**k are yall?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just cant remember it all

What am I doin? What am I doin?
Oh, yeah, thats right, Im doin me
Im doin me
Im livin life right now, mayne

And this what Ima do til its over
Til its over
But its far from over

Yeah, thats right, Im doin me
Im doin me
Im livin life right now, mayne

And this what Ima do til its over
Til its over
But its far from over

Sorry for the miscommunication
I need a drink and some tequila with you
You know what I'm trying to do
Hey, let's pop the E off at Liv
I've got some time here to blow
I've got the money to blow
I've got the money and blow
Don't have to guess how I know

She think it's wavy and gnarly
I think I'mma pop one for you

Still in Miami
Most of these girls are too messy
I've got to do some reflecting
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction
I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like brrrrr
I'm on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type
I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight
PND ain't with the ray tay, you know Jay Wray
Got girls here going way way way way way way
Sauga city trip the pay day
Glo'd up off a gate way, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in their feelings these days
All in their feelings these days
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes
You should be afraid

I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got sh*t on what you're feeling now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man
Yeah I said it, B*tch I'm the man
Don't you forget it

The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in the speaker right now: that's me
And the voice in the mirror, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted, with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason that you always getting faded

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me

Ok look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things

It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of "Mr Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me


May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you
And heaven accept you..

You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you're the f-cking coldest
Intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

Well aren't you a breath of fresh air
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they aint got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking somes d-cks until some millions appear
Voila! you do it right he might just buy you a car
Unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre
Independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer
Make it rain finger (check)
M3 beamer (check)
Champagne range
Triple white Caddy
Closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and BeBe
Ya don't need it greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who f-ck for bowls of baked ziti

Go, go, go, go, go, go
As we proceed.


Uh, 5 and a half in boys
Ass is off the hook
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never
But never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever
You just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas
And enough money to loan us a little something extra
Should we ever need it
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it

I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost


I’ve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn’t change
And I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? please don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours we both know
We know, they don’t get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste,ah
Pushing me away so I give her space,ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
I’ll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don’t know
Trying to run from that, say you’re done with that
On your face girl, it just don’t show
When you’re ready, just say you’re ready
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
And the party's over, just don’t forget me
We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won’t ever have to worry,
You won’t ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes


Cause if you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost


Yeah
It’s my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can’t deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don’t say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you’re following your heart
Cause your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know, you hate being alone
You ain’t the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin’ to save you
Instead they say,
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true


I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost 

I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous a**
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your a**
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that s*** you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same

Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that noila got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?

Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been?
You deserve rounds tonight, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight

I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

You understand me?
Showtime, headlines
Big time, sunshine, tote nines
Bust mines, flatline, hard grind
High life, stay fly as jet time
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga
Stunt nigga
I might just bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it



I was born with a dick in my brain
Yea fucked in the head
My step-father said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
"Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?"
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said, 
"I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid"
The bastard won't even eat nothing he scared
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead
Debby don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there stick a fucking cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's faking it
I bet you, I'll bet he prolly wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course unless you object
Ah, go fuck his brains out if any is left in his head



If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane



You get it? No I just tried to bite my face off
I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw bit the fucking blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop
Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like king kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he layed all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants he took every fucking thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yea, maniac that Shady dog
Man that motherfuckers gangsta, ain't he dog?
Shady dog, what be going through that fucking brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waiting for? Sing along.




Don't you know what felch means? (Yea)
Well then tell me, would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp belch and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying man? can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my step-father felt me
Fuck a little puppet kick the puppy while he's yelping
Shady what the fuck you saying? I don't know help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fucking melting!
Marshall I just love you boy I care about your well-being
No dad I said no, I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy I can do it by myself see
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it Pubic Hair on Chelsey
Well this is called Ass-Rape and we're shooting the Jail scene




Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?


Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There is vomit on his sweater already
Moms spaggehti he's nervous
But on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over BLOW!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that
But he's broke, he's so sad that he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home
That's when it's back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody, better go capture this moment
And hope it don't collapse on him


You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better


Soul's escapin' through this hole's that is gaping
This world is mines for the taking
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring
But superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads got him
He knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold ya nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold prada
They moved on to the next shmo who flows
Who nose dove and sold nada
And so the so proper
His toll, it unfolds and I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on
Duh duh doe, duh doe, dah dah dah dah




No more games, I'ma change for due called rage
Tear this muthafuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped writin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Pfifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's gettin' even harder tryin' to feed and water
My seed plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a pre-madonna
Baby momma drama, screamin' on her
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotony 
Has gotten me to the point
I'm like a snail, I've got to formulate a plot
Or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only muthafuckin' option, failure's not
Momma love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot
Feet fail me not
Cause maybe the only opportunity that I got




Duh doo
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Just the two of us.. 


Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Just the two of us..

Intro:
Where's my snare
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you eva been hated, or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin', and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigga me, but they'll neva figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probley sick of me now
Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ha!

I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Imma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a coupla months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side,
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work
Wit her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I grew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't't't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, MA!
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, MA!
But guess what, ya gettin' olda now and it's cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your FUNERAL
See whets hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yaself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get,
You selfish bitch
I hope you fuckin' burn in in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Let's get it, I can't wait to trick man
It's gonna be so sweet
Summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine

Still like, "Can you hit it with your OVO goose on?"
I'm like, "What are you on?"
Told me that she two on, ha, that's cute we a few on
I could show you what to do in this bitch
Take the addy with the water pop two and then sip
Me, you and your bitch
And we talkin' bout life, love too and this dick
First I had her in the six, then we had her in the six
You know I got another bar for ya
I'mma chill baby, we don't want the devil in this bitch, nah
Got a bad one we could call it Kelly Rowland
Oh she get the jelly rollin', Akinyele in the telly
Cause she open I could tell that she from Oakland
Pasadena, what up?

I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2

A nigga got a woosah, comin' at me never work no matter who try
I got 'em all a cheque without the woo-hah
Flip modes on ya quick got a few sides
Comin' from the 6 side
Where niggas goin' shower posse just to get by
Stay true never switch sides, yea, the game turn me into this guy
Yea, and now every time Drake out
Cameras always flashing tryna put me on the Takeout
Crib in Calabasas man I call that shit the safe house
Thirty minutes from L.A. the shit is way out
But these days that's where I'm stayin'
You can hear it in my voice I'm goin' way in
Yea, OB that my brother like a Wayans
Just know I only show up if you payin', nigga
Yea, I always been on, I always been too on
For like the past five years all these niggas wanna shine
I got the flashlight here man
Bout to hit the gas right here man
Old soul livin' in the past life here man
You, bring the cash right here man
Miracle, sit your ass right here man
Man, You know I hate to wait
That's why I get it first and you get it late
Yea, OVO sound that man that's everyday
It's Young Money Records get the record straight

I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2 on
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2

You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so bad girl, you're so awful
I fuck you right in my office
You go tell your friends you're honest
That's why all your friends are on
You know you made me a promise
We're not in this for commitment
Your man's gone and you don't miss him
Book you flights and confirmation
Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasing that paper
Even though you're exhausted you're still gonna make it girl
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so, you're so
You love to get 2 on

And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know that I put you on
And you know, that's something yo

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
Last name ever 
First name greatest 
Like a sprained ankle boy ainâ€™t nothing to play with 
It started off local but thanks to all the haters 
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis 
And your city faded off to brown, Nino 
She insists she got more class, we know 
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo 
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo 
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album 
Whoâ€™d have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome 
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm 
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one 
Yeah nigga Iâ€™m about my business 
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list 
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness 
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness 
Bitches 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
I used to have hood dreams 
Big fame, big chains 
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came 
I went hard all fall like the ball teams 
Just so I can make it rain all spring 
Yâ€™all seen my story my glory 
I had raped the game young 
You can call it statutory 
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me 
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin 
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin 
You would think I ran the world like Michelleâ€™s husband 
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnâ€™t 
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnâ€™t 
Youâ€™re such a fucking loser 
He didnâ€™t even go to class Bueller 
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back 
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack 
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac 
All the way in Hollywood and I canâ€™t even act 
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap 
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
Ok, hello it's da Martian 
Space jam Jordanâ€™s 
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden 
Fresher than the harvest 
Step up to the target 
If I had one guess than I guess Iâ€™m just New Orleans 
And I will never stop like Iâ€™m running from the cops 
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top 
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops 
But what should I scream for this is my theme park 
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark 
Pistol on my side you donâ€™t wanna hear that thing talk 
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention 
Lil Wayne thatâ€™s what they got to say or mention 
Iâ€™m like Nevada in the middle of the summer 
Iâ€™m resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover 
Shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas 
No brake pads, no such thing as last 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
There they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow 
Nuts they go, macadamia they go so ballistic, whoa 
We can make them look like Bosoâ€™s 
Heâ€™s wondering if he should spit this slow 
Fuck no! Go for broke 
His cup just runneth over, oh no 
He ainâ€™t had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed 
Theyâ€™ve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose 
Back into the game and they know 
Rap will never be the same as before 
Bashing in the brains of these hoes 
And establishing a name as he goes 
The passion and the flame is ignited 
You canâ€™t put it out once we light it 
This shit is exactly what the fuck that Iâ€™m talking about when we riot 
You dealinâ€™ with a few true villains 
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillinâ€™ 
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths 
Now rewind it! 
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me, so howâ€™s it taste? 
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place 
Iâ€™m Hannibal Lecter so just in case youâ€™re thinking of saving face 
You ainâ€™t gonna have no face to save by the time Iâ€™m through with this place 
So Drakeâ€¦ 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man

byy: chelsey baybayy!!

That's what they doin', Cameron, they actin' like these singers, man.
I ain't goin' to the studio until I got a situation.
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer.
Who gonna be on the hook?
Man, what is you doin'?
Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!

Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though
Voice mail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, "nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, "the first mill gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work

Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)

Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man

Hear What?
Yo hear what, tek time
(Laughing)
Ahh, no shit!
Yo hear what?
Wa gwan ...
Yo him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van you know Drizzy

Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing

I do better with the rider in my system
Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called "Hi! My Name Is" dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I've went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain, the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to…

I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

I know what it's like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in that trailer park?
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than make another motherfucking "We Made You", uh
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania,
So when they empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was... gone

I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way o-o-out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear

YEAHH !!!

Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker. Boys playin' Playstation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?

Yeah, sound sound sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this?
How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions
We ain't doing no interview

Yeah, yeah, oh, you gotta love it
Oh, you got, oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried
It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual, my career's like a "how to "manual
So I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we have words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to R.I.P. about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But man, oh, you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it


Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn’t everything
I’m having a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that i'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time 
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well never mind,
I I I tried to told you, drizzy still ain’t nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cars saying fuck ya life
Okay now we outta here
Toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up
I got the voodoo for you bitches
I’m busy getting rich, I don’t want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double
Famous like a drug that I've taken too much
I never ever trip
Just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does


I'm about whatever man..

Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her Imma get her
I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mix tape?
That was just a keepsake
Bought the president the Louie presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks I ain’t talking about the peach state
Man for Petes sake scratch that, sweep stakes
(hahahaha)
Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you like no
I’m a bad bitch I ain’t never been a mixed breed.
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed
M M M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
But I collect 100 thou at the venue
And pop bottles with my team young money til the death of me


I'm about whatever man..
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it

Whole crews in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team. Man I love my team..

I be up all night..
Whole crews in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team. Man I love my team..

I've been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? It can't be
They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
I promise to always give you me, the real me


Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go


Owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright life'd make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumbs could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do


Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Wait until the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again
Soon as you get in

Drake]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got sh*t on what you're feeling now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man
Yeah I said it, B*tch I'm the man
Don't you forget it

The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in the speaker right now: that's me
And the voice in the mirror, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted, with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason that you always getting faded

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me

Ok look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things

It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of "Mr Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me


May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you
And heaven accept you..

CHORUS (1x):


END!!!


Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you


I'm just so fucking depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump,
but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up, 
in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided to just pick this pen
Up to try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, 
I need a new outlet
And I know some shits so hard to swallow, 
but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you got to walk a thousand miles


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humour
Everything's so tense and gloom, I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room
Just as soon as I walk in, It's like all eyes on me, 
so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that it then it opens the door for conversation, 
like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, 
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, 
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack, and half of them ain't even funny,
like "AAHHHHH!
Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn!"
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell, hell
We don't gotta trade our shoes, and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves, and flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could of either just sat on my ass, and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in, and get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never 
did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me, keep making that face til it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there holding my tounge, 
tryna talk like BLEGH!
Then I stuck my tounge on that frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson then, 
'cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story, not just based off my description
Cause where you see it form where you're sitting, 
is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a miles in eachothers shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you

Yeah, to my babies, stay strong, dad will be home soon
And to the rest of the world... God gave you them shoes, to fit you
So put them on and wear them... be yourself man, 
be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny... 
don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful



I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly,
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home (home)

I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly,
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it (oh yeah)
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

So just hold on we're going home (going home)
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on we're going home (going home, going home)

You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Oh just hold on we're going home (going home)
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on we're going home (going home, going home)
Hold on 


Cause some things just don’t change
It’s better when they stay the same
Althought the whole world knows your name
So on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game
Ooooohhhhhhh
It shouldn’t be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice you remain
fuck em’ all, tell ‘em all eat shit, here we go again

So, god damn… is it that time again already
Haha, you don’t look too happy to see me
fuck man, don’t everybody welcome me back at once
All right, fuck ya’ll then


You can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, I’m nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, Dog fall back you mutts
fuck your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy
fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck sick mummy
And my nuts licked, gobble ‘em up trick, yummy
 b**ch you don’t fucking think that I know that you suck dick dummy?
You’ll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it’s funny!
Shawty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don’t listen to ‘em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker
Motherfucker might aswell let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, cause I’m just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on, cause you wen’t and pissed me off
Now I’m sitting and pissing on everbody
give a fuck if it’s right or wrong
So buck the buddah, light a bong
But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, cmon


Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh


fuck it I’m a loose cannon, Bruce Banner’s back in the booth
Ya’ll are sitting ducks, I’m the only goose standing
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my d*ck in a circle, but I’m not fucking around motherfucker
I’ll show you pussy footin, I’ll kick a bitch in the cunt
Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin’, you musta mistook me for some sissy
Soft punk looking for some nookie or boosom
Go ahead, fucking hater push me
I told you ain’t no fucking way to shush me
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G’s up
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!)
Man chill, nah I can’t god damnit
Rap is a land fill, drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can’t fill
shit the day that happens the world’ll stop spinning
And Michael J. Fox’ll come to a stand still
During an earthquake, urine in your face
Cause you’re fake, ahh what the fuck, that hurt wait!
Ahh what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening
Alright then I quit, god I give up
Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To hell I’ll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh


How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day
til I hang up the mic and it’s time for me to say
So long, til then i drop the fucking bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long
If you don’t like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh b**ches don’t like that, homie I’ll be nicer to women
When aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming
lyrics courtesy of killer hip hop dot com
Man I’m a cold soul, I roll solo so
So don’t compare me to them other bums over there
It’s like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
I’m bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I’ll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

(Outro)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I don’t know, I don’t know what caused, I don’t know what caused me to be this wayme to be this way
I don’t know, I don’t know by I probably be this way til my dying day
I don’t know why I’m so, I’m so cold beat bangs, I don’t need to say
I guess this is how you made me



Uh
I’m just so far gone
October’s own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screaming in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on
Where did we go wrong
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game
And its one I can’t post pone
Meaning if it rains
I’m the one its raining on
With my diamond chain’s on
Still nothing setting stone
Women borrow sweaters
That I spray with my cologne
And tell me don’t forget them
And I promise that I won’t
Feeling so distant from everyone I’ve known
To make everybody happy
I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown
Parties that we’ve thrown
I done more for this city
Than these rappers that have blown
Its only been 3 years
Look at how I’ve grown
I’m just in my zone
I call this shit the calm

Yeah

But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom
And I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay
And it wont even take that long
You can see it in my face
Even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school
Its proven and its known
I’m sittin’ in a chair
But in the future, it’s a throne
I know you like to worry
It’d be better if you don’t
Cuz….


You know…
Everything gone be all right
I promise
I apologize to you know
Put y’all in this position
40 Mama always say
Don’t ask permission, just ask forgiveness you know
So uhh
Forgive me
Yeah


Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a vantage you can gain
They love it when you smile
Unaware that it’s a strain
It’s a curse you gotta live with
When you’re born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say you’re the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Terrence in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It’s a weight that’s on my chest
Who ever spottin’ me is playin’
So I’m liftin’ all alone
Trynin’ not to get a sprain
Hopin’ Western Junior doin’ currency exchange

Cuz my dad called
It got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like
I had a rolls and I went and got a range
And he payin’ for his cigarettes
With some dollars and some change
Yeah
And I can only feel his pain
Cuz in Memphis, Tennessee
There is only so much to attain
So I’m fillin’ out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me
I just hope he doesn’t say that shit in vain
I’m why your girls heart is in a slain
Call me Heartbreak Drake
I’m the hardest one to tame
As a man, I’m just honest
As an artist, I’m a king
With my own set of problems
That be sittin’ on my brain
Yeah
And see this is the thang
What they viewin’ as braggin’
Is the way that I maintain
The shit I write
While starin’ out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I remain

Me


Yeah…
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
That’s why I’m putting on
They always wanna ask what type of act that you putting on
Like…. Damn 


Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn’t be driving, it just got so much harder
Can’t even see straight, I can’t even see straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I’m the truth that’s right I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain’t gotta die to get to heaven
You Girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How’d I know, how’d I know? That’s me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you asking me my where-abouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rappin’ bitches, rappin’ bitches bitches
And rappin’ rappin’ an’ bitches until all of us switches
I swear, it’s been two years since somebody ask me who I was
I’m the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
That’s whats important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing “walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I’m a uptown nigga, ah”
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways


People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)


Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon’ tell me that she don’t dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that’s all I’m really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin’ furs like its snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that’s the shit that she like
So why am I a classic, this is who I’m trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turnin’ papers in won’t get me paid
If I don’t nothing I’mma ball
I’m countin all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah I need that, making major changes to the life I’m living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways



People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)

Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do


All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting, I told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

 

Hello
Yeah I just walked in
Yeah I'm good you still working?
Tonight, right now?
'Did I go out' yeah I went out
I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed
Shit... wine or water
You said something about a cold drink
I don't know, I'm delirious... night


Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy

But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
"F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing thats so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say

F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin' 'bout bitches
That we almost had
I don't think I'm concious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeh we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeh, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women thats living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on


Well I'm sorry" -- Drake
Are you drunk right now? -- Woman

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me


You're not going to come?
Guess i'm bout to just kick it here then...

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Drizzy,
Oh yeah Trey I fucking feel you,
They be staring at the money like it's unfamiliar,
I get it,
I live it,
To me there's nothings realer,
Just enough to solve your problems,
Too much would kill ya,
And when I leave,
I always come right back here,
The young spit it and everybody in rap fear,
A lot of ya'll still sounding like last year,
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier,
Nickels for my thoughts,
Dimes in my bed,
Quarters of the kush,
Ain't the limes in my head,
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD,
Yeah,
I want it all,
That's why I strive for it,
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it,
I know what's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Yeah,
I want things to go my way,
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,
And my mother tried to runaway from home,
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway,
And she cried to me so I cried too,
And my stomach was soaking wet,
She only 5'2,
And 48 hours all before I showed up,
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
Damn my reality just set in,
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
I do a lot of things,
Hoping I never have to fit in,
So trying to keep up with my programs is like a dead end,
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
And life change for us every single week,
So what's good,
But I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Wise words from a decent man,
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand,
This lost boy got fly without peter pan,
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,
In person I am everything and more,
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,
Just call me shop and bag drizzy,
And call me Mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy,
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad,
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
To big homie use a flash if you must,
And I swear I ain't asking for much
All I want is


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

It's like I know what I got to say,
I just don't know how to say it to you


Pardon the swag,
But bitches cartate,
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,
How come I can't,
Miss a woman like I can't miss cartdates,
Cheese,
But shes not in this portrait,
Life's fine but I don not portray,
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
I don't want the glow,
I want the glow ray,
And I'm a fuck the world,
But this is just foreplay,
Tired of hearing bullshit,
Bring her on to cowshit,
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than ? shit,
That's word to toronto,
So high up I got birds in the condo,
Ain't that a female dog,
Ask her who I am to her,
And she yell god,
Weezy baby go ? hard,
No further details boy.

Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah.


I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far


I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
"Cleaning Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause, Ma,
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to Chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away it drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old,
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but




'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for "Cleaning Out My Closet", at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though,
'cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own,
But now the medications taken over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have,
'cause one thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths,
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest,
I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my mama...




I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girl
So I never say, "Goodbye, cruel world."
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die



I want a new life 


It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya
See ya picture, now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya


Yeah, one time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch


I'm so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need


I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Air Force stunting flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that muthafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on


I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Takin' everything slow, so slow, so slow but I do it to her


Drapped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end


Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rollin' through the city
Bumpin' that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like everything just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone

Uh,
I'm just so far gone, 
October's own, 
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong,
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown,
parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne

You know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A
Pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
You know, so... forgive me
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

Uh,
And life is so insane, 
Look what I've became, 
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why yo girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain

Me, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man.


Yeah, uh-huh


Uh, hardly home but always reppin,
You hardly on and always second,
When I'm awake you always restin,
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question,
I, I'm doin classic shit in all my sessions,
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin,
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions,
I just always did my own thing,
Now I run the game, you stupid muddasuckas
I see all this money through my ohio state buck eyes,
Shippin goin good, but good can turn to better,
Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
come on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
come on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Yeah, wrong way down the one way,
Women don't get saved round me even on a sunday,
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who,
Then they meet my pop and tell 'I'm ''Drake is just a younger you'',
And shawty wanna party so don't let yo girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ, of me givin her mouth-to-mouth,
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her,
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcom X an Martin Luther
I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady,
They just loose to love, those are tennis games lady,
Have you countin money goin dufflebag-crazy,
Sippin on Pink Floyd an puffin Wayne Brady,
Damn, who's line is it anyways,
I'm in the daze, you been amazed, y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage,
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze,
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right,
You look nice, and yo frame, makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well alright, guess I might, know what fuck it yes I will,
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin less than real
Put it to you right


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
come on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest,
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused,
The gangstas recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's,
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus,
Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this ibomb, I palm
The game like it's a spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great mike,
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this gon be a great night,
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white,
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,
This that major moment you've been waitin on for too long,
The best that ever did it an doin it on a new song,
UGK an Young Money too strong
Down in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


I am the leather jacket, black glasses, all american bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket an you, you just a bag boy
Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you neva had boy
Hate an I will leave ya chest the color of my flag boy
Super bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
An I keep that toaster you can come an be my strudel biiiitch
I'm so uptown, an mothafucker if you aint don't go uptown,

And now I'm on that rock-shit
But why they let me in I'm a start shootin at a mosh pit, haha
Fuck is you talkin bout, weezy in ya mouth now

It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that

Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on




(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
> Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will serve you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?


(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right


(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right
Aw Yeah

(Intro) 

Yeah, can't stop now... 
This maybe the last chance I get, to be famous 

(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 1) 

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist, they call me Slim Rothelsberger 
I get beserker than a fed up post office worker 
A murker with a mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered 
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter 
For a gangsta, you should of shit your pants when you saw 
The chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel 
I faced her around when his fangs come out, get your brains blown out 
That's what I call blowing your mind, when I come back like nut on your spine 
I'm a thumbtac that you slept on son 
Now here I come screaming "attack" like I just stepped on one! 
Lowering the totem til' he showed 'em, defiance, giant scrotum 
He don't owe them bitches shit, his bridges, he out wrote 'em 
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the south pole and 
Nobody fucks with him, rigamortis and post-mortem 
He's dying of boredom, take your best rhymes, record 'em 
Then try to thwart him, he'll take your punchlines and snort 'em 
Shit stained drawers, you gon' fuck with the guy that licks the blades of his chainsaws 
While he dips 'em in P.F. chang's sauce 
Game's off homie, hang it up like some crank calls 
You think I'm backing down, you must be out your dang skulls! 
I'm almost famous 


(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 2) 

I'm back for revenge, I lost the battle, that ain't happening again 
I'm at your throat like strep, I step strapped with a pen 
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are distorting my mem-ory 
Some are wrote on a napkin, do what I have to to win 
Pulling out all stops, any who touch a mic prior 
Is not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers 
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the whacko 'for 
I take a shit in his jackolantern then smash it on his porch 
Now get off my dick, dick's too short of a word for my dick 
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism you prick! 
Don't call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer 
I just blew up the challenger, matter of fact, I need a lawyer 
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast 
Beat his ass naked and pee'd in his corner like Verne Troyer 
Ya'll are Eminem backwards, you're menime's 
See he's in a-whole-nother weight class, his slugs your BB's 
Your bean bag bullets, you're full of it, you were dissing his CD's 
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheeties 
No peace treaty's, he's turned into a beast 
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the might DRE 
He's almost famous 

(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 3) 

Now there he goes, in Dre's studio, cupping his balls 
Screaming the wood off the panelling, cussing the paint off the walls 
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads 
He ain't giving 'em shit, he's scissor pinch a penny so hard 
He'll leave a bruise on the brawn so dark 
You can see the mark when it scars, til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out "AHHH!" 
His metaphors and similies ain't similar to them not at all 
If they don't like they can all get fucked, instead of sucking him off 
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by 
Like David Carridy, they can go fuck themselves and just die 
And eat shit while they at it, he's fucking had it 
He's mad at the whole world, so go to hell and build a snowman, girl 
The bullies become bullied, the pussies get pushed 
They better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me 
Cause I ain't looking back only forward, this whole spot blowing 
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it 
And while I'm being poetic, let me get a stork 
And raise the bar higher than my opinion of these women ? 
So bare witness to some biblical shit 
As the cold wind blowing, this world ain't gonna know what hit it, he did it, he made it, he's finally famous!

Can I dig it
when you baby me
oooh oooh, oooh
my darl..
oooh
my darling baby
you're in...


Uh, more beautiful than the world
Word, matter of fact beautiful ain't the word
unexplainable is the beauty of her
and I will be the race car hitting her curves
errrrr
I drive her crazy, stupid retarded
yeah and then I park it
she got a smile on her that put a smile on me

she ride for me even though I got miles on me
she gon ride till the day they put flowers on me
thats my darling
and I love it, yeh

but she so good I'll take the cavity
falling for her like how safe is gravity
I'll make your girl about face and marry me
hahahaha, yeh

but ahhh, the things I'm willing to do for her
I wish I could have a threesome with two of her

How did I end up right here with you
after all the things that I been through
its been one of those days

let’s get right
now that I’m here baby...


show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
show me a good
show me a good
show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)


I live for the nights that I can’t remember,
with the people that I won’t forget
spending all the money I just work my ass off
for the things that I won’t regret
I’ve been waiting way too long long long long
tellin’ everybody that I know we about to be on on on on
I ain’t tryin’ look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with
that’s my team, never would I let a woman come between
what we doing right now
this our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream
I’m the Osirus of the shit right now
go to guy for the hits right now
whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now
if you can’t hold your liquor you better quit right now





How ’bout you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed
make the most out of tonight and worry bout it all tomorrow
understand girl, we fam girl
can’t get me right and I do Wayne
Cash money young money pop champagne
Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
people really hate when a backpack rapper get rich
and start livin’ that life dawg
feels like when you gettin’ to that paper hip hop hates ya
they would do it just like I do if they could
its in our nature
ahh, young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer
I came up in the underground though
so I’ma spend another ten thousand for Dilla
call me over rated or creative or too jaded
because any way you put it bitch I made it, YUP




Whoah!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
and like, back and forth because ah
this is.. what you thought it wasn't
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background*
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...


Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smocking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swinging, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman


So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screaming _Fuck the World_ like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck!!
Talking that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck!!


I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Search to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below friezing
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snorting, supporting abortion
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an Afghan




Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screaming like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinning
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfucking style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washing dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smocking weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in




Hey, fuck that!
Outsidaz..
Pace One..
Young Zee..


Yeah boy,
better ring the alarm boy,
dem know its coming boy,


Oh my God, f-cking Bomboclat
I’m hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire,
tie a whore up with barbed wire, nothing but a broad boy,
I’m the real deal, and char-broiler on the bonfire
and Bon Voyage bitch, I’m like Chef Boyar-
-dee in this bitch; send a bomb to my moms lawyer
Im a problem for ya, boy you think your Tom Sawyer,
til I pull you out the f-cking story book and stomp on ya,
f-cking fictitional characters and fariytales,
prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris Wheels,
but it aint fiction its fact boy beware its real
them lyrics you wield equals zero to a hero’s shield
Mr fly by the seat of his pants parasail
or hit the trampoline bounce and grab a pair of stilts,
and I aint wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no nada,
like your fa-da f-cking ya mada


Drop the bomb on em,

Drop the bomb on em,

shady please, please dont drop the bomb on me,
Drop the bomb on em
I dont want no dog gone beef,
see aint no reason to set the dogs on me,


Boy, Im the real McCoy,

me and Dre steel alloys,
the rap crown royals,
that scalp cowboys
now how that sound for ya
yeah boy you know we about to put it down for ya,
so kick your shoes off,
before you have a sound voyage,
and siyanara see ya f-ckers tommorow,
get some R and R and marinate in some marinara,
and have a coke and a smile, dont make me open a jar,
whip ass on ya, thats the last straw your hoping to draw,
yeah you fresher than most boy, I’m just doper than all boy,
I’m that boy boy, them boys them no up to par
I just show up go up to the stage and blow up the spot,
there aint no boy who can do what I do boy Im a star,
boy, I told you boy, Im a Soldier boy, Im DeShaun,
Holten in this B-tch, Im the Proof boy your a fraud,
I destroy you boy, f-ck around and blow ya to Sod
oh my God boy, you didn’t go there, no you did not,
I got a whole story board for you, boy your da plot,
your gettin got whether you try to avoid it or not,
apology not accepted boy, Detroit is a rock,
we get to beefing, aint no telling at what point it will stop,
all I got to do is point to the spot,
when the bomb drops boy does it drop,
and when it does boy there’s a problem,




Boy dont jinx yourself,
boy I’m Michael Spinks with the belt,
Stringer bell boy, my name rings bells for itself,
I’m sick as hell boy,
you better run and tell someone else,
Bringin hell boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
and to that boy who done said it …,
who said he was better,
lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
i bet he never seen Freddie in a Black and red little sweater,
back better than ever,
the chedder shredder the grater the beef grinder
I’ll settle vendettas a little later,
giving haters incubators, think ya made a mistake,
by saying Shady was ghost, I ain’t even close to the gate
you bout a foot in the grave, stay put and behave
Im bout to turn this f-cking place to Beirut in a day
so hey wouldn’t you say Im the sh-t,
couldn’t agree with you more if you were to say my f-cking sh-t doesn’t stink,
shady f-cking aftermath boy the ship doesn’t sink it just floats int he f-cking water
til we fill up the tank,

Your walkin down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the mornin
And your in a
Nightmare
It's HORRIBLE
Right there's the coroner
Waitin for you
To turn the corner
So he can corner ya
Your a goner
He's ona ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
Cause you can't run anymore
Your done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody
Is watchin in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplading my next plot again
Swallowin the Klonopin
While I'm noddin
In and out on the autumn and
If the ramada inn
Holdin onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at mcdonalds
With
Blood all over me
Dead bodies
Behind the counter
SHIT
Guess I must of just blacked out again
NOT AGAIN

It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

( 2)
Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel
Until I find hannah montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin
Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin
Every candle on top of the fire place
Mantalin
Grab my flannel and my bandana then
Kiss the naked manakin man again
You can see him standin in my
Front window
If you look in
I'm just a hooligan
Who's use to usin hallicinogens
Causin illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Raise the scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules too
Me
What am I gone do
Had the prodical son
The diabolical one
Very methodical
I slaughtered them

()
It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and

She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I duck and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I
Had that much fun
Off a half pint of the jack
My last vic and a half
A flashlight
Up kim kardashians ass

I remember the first time
I dismembered a family member
December I think it was
I was having drinks with my cuz
And I wrapped him
In christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin tub
Cut him up into pieces
Then just when I went to drink his
Blood
I thought I outta drink this bath water
That outta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me
That might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams
Just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 am
And here I come
So you should probably run
A secret passage way around here
Man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs
It aint no stoppin me from choppin him up(up)

()
Cause it's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havn’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our seperate ways
So i’m single...
Thinking about what we had and missing you
But I aint santa, I got something for these bad b*tches too
I mean paprazzi on me trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthaf*ckin heart out, its drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me do I ever cross your mind
Because all this sh*t is new to me, i’m learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good
I know that n*ggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed
I promise to stay the same


I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest


(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me

(I'm doin my thing 3x)
I'm tryna be unforgettable...


This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say fo' life yall say fo'ever
Its hard but it's fair I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The names young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’m gon need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers

(?) so whats the deali young done everything in the A but f*ck chillin
So welcome to my life no two days the same
Like for yall to meet the love of my life her names the game


I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest


(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I'm doin my thing 3x)
I'm tryna be unforgettable...

It's over, yeah it's over yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone

Man, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving, yeah I'm leaving, yeah I'm leaving, I'm gone

No looking back when I'm gone
No more (x16)

It's over, yeah it over, yeah I'm leaving, I'm gone
I've been doing this wrong, I've been here for too long
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit at home, I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid I'mma die before I get where I'm going
I know I'mma be alone
I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta hit a road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta know the road

Something is said, don't say that again
I just been out and bad from way back when

I can't be out here on no laid back shit
You got something to say, then say that thing

The mad rapper whether i got money or not {yup}
As long as i'm on pills, and i got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin' makin' fun of your yacht
But i would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in the source
And a wardrobe i can afford
Otherwise i might get sent up back-strike in a ford
And you wonder what the fuck i need more vicadive
Everybody's pissin' me off; even a no limit tank looks like
A middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit i'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would i kill you and jump in a grave and bury myself

{just pull the plug!}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin' to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
{just let it go!}
(repeat all 2x)


I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than rosco beating james tar senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {ouch ouch}
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that i used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, i kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that i failed 9th grade
You probably think that i'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, i just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
As i fall down a cement flight of steps (ahhhh)
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

{just let it go}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin' to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
{just pull the plug!}
(repeat all 2x)


My basic disk will make you take a razor into your wrist
Make you satanistic
Make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains
Are rippin' out your skull so bad
And sew you back and be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "role model," i don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and hailey jade is shady's business
And shady's just an alias i made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when gil was payin me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You may be gettin' a bigger attitude than maybe kim's got
And the shit's almost got the same fate that grady's bitch got
I know that "just the two of us" would make you hate me this much
And just the two of us
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life
It's just words on a mic.
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a show business pig
But the funny shit is that i still go with the bitch

{just let it go}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin' to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
{just pull the plug!}
(repeat all 2x)


I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure


How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9am in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?


Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas lookin' like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowin' that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's gettin' into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lackin' synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it’s meant to be
Paranoid, always rollin' with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

As i fall deeper into a manic state
Im a prime canidate for the gene to recieve the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of night quil then i salivate
Start off with the night quil like i think i'll just have a taste
Couple sips of that then i gradually graduate 
Too a harder perscription drug called valium like ya that's great
I go to take just one and i end up like having eight 
Now i need something in my stomach cuz i haven't ate
Maybe i'll grab a plate of nachos and i'll have a steak
And you'd think with all i have at stake
Look at my daughters face....
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad i think 
He's acting weird again he's really begining to scare me
Wont shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos 
And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat 

( Hook )
Sometimes i feel so alone,
I just dont know ,feels like i been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as i go home and close the door,
kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place i do,
But i cant and i wont say i tried but i know thats a lie cuz i dont
and why i just dont know..... 


( 2 )
Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer 
Thats the devil in my ear i been sober a fuckin year
And that fucker still talks to me he is all i can fuckin hear
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers
And maybe if i just drink half i'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man i got half a mind
Too have another half of glass of wine sound acinine
Ya i know
But i never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch im about to fall
I missed the couch and down i go looking like a bouncing ball
Shit must have knocked me out cuz i aint feel the ground at all
Wow what the fuck happend last night where am i
Man fuck am i hungover and god damn i got a head ache 
Shit half a vicodin why cant i ? 
" All systems ready for take off please stand by "

So i take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh 
A couple weeks go by it aint even like im getting high
now i need it just not to feel sick ya im getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die 
Oh ya theres an excuse you lose proof so you use 
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin you to get through
It's twelve noon aint no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes
now here i am 3 months later full blown relapse
Just get high untill the kids get home from two homes relax
And since im convinced that im in-somniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so i take 3 naps 
Just to be able to function throughout the day lets see 
That's an ambian each nap how many valium 3
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken 4 years just too put out an album b 
See me and you we almost had the same outcome he
Cuz that christmas you know the nomonia thing
It was bolognya was it the methadone ya think 
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos 
your vcr tape cases with you ambian cr great places to hide aint it
So you can lie to hailie im going beddy bye whitney baby good night elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor

Yo, I can't sing it....

I feel like singin'....

I wanna fuckin' sing...

Cuz I'm happy..
Yeah......I'm happy

Ha Ha, I got my baby back...

Yo, check it out 


Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think theres nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry 

Somtimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wasting my time? 

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 


Somtimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me 


My baby girl  keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, cuz they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side 

I act like shit don't phase me,
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive 

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 




Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singing this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mum didn't abort
Now you probly get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his momma,
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Cuz there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul,
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breaking should I just give up,
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself,
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin'hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted are nothing to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': 
3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to peoples backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', why'd I stick my penis up in?
Woulda ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted 

Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cuz my baby know's that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me 
Category:  Music

That's the shit I'm talking about though
Like you changed up
You don't even fucking link nobody no more
You just dash me away like a cyattie
Yo, you cheesed me dog

Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it’s dark out 
To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss ya
Shit’ll come back around and get ya
Crazy like all my niggas
Crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the BAR exam
I drove in the snow for you
You probably don’t remember half the shit a nigga did for you

Ya, you ain’t really fuck with me way back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
How bout now?
Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?

Always been daddy’s little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain’t even say thank you
I had no money
Left from back when I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like “who’s this?”
I be like “me, girl.”
You be like “oh word, true shit?”
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel I have it like that
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I’m not even Christian I still went to church that year
Guess, I just had to pretend that year
I ain’t even see my friends that year
Places that I should’ve been

You ain’t really fuck with me way back then
But how bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
How bout now?
Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?

Why do I feel so alone? 
Like everybody passing through the studio ,
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role ,
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know,
And I don't have the heart to give these, 
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go, 
So they stick around kicking out feedback, 
And I entertain it as if I need that, 
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that,
My privacy about the only thing I need back but, 
It's hard to think of them polite flows, 
Mr. Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes, 
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes, 
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed, 
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows, 
Life was so full, 
Now this shit just being lipo'd, 
Always said I'd say it all on the right track, 
But in this game you only lose when you fight back, 
Black diamond bracelets, 
Showing you the basics, 
I can't live and hold the camera, 
Someone gotta tape this, 
I make hits unlike a bitch, 
That's married I ain't miss, 
24 hours from greatness, 
I'm that close, 
Don't ever forget the moment, 
You began to doubt, 
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out, 
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South, 
Watchin' whole show, 
Embarrassed to pull my camera out, 
And my mother embarrassed, 
To pull my Phantom out, 
So I park about 5 houses down, 
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown, 
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around, 
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus, 
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness, 
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus, 
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless, 
And promoters try to get me out to they club, 
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how, 
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, 
Standing with my next girl, 
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now, 
And shit could get weird unless they all down, 
And so I stay clear.

We from a small town, 
Everybody talks and everybody listen, 
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing, 
I've always been something that these labels can't buy, 
Especially if they tryin' to take a peice of my sou,l 
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez "Damn Drake fly" 
And he just be like "Silly mother fucker I know" 
That was your bad, 
How could you pass up on 'em? 
He just take them records, 
And he gas up on 'em, 
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em, 
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em, 
Oh they did Po, 
At least they tried to, 
And that's what happens, 
When you spitting what's inside you, 
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video, 
And they think they can market you, 
However they decide to nahh, 
But Forty told me to do me, 
And don't listen to anybody that knew me, 
'Cause to have known me would, 
Mean that there's a new me, 
And if you think I changed in the slightest, 
Could of fooled me, 
Boy in my city I'm da 2-3, 
Drug dealers live vicariously through me, 
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy, 
I'm just not the social type, 

And campus life is crazy understand, 
I could get money with my eyes closed, 
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo, 
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll, 
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know, 
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will, 
I got new shit, 

I'm gettin' better still, 
Little niggas put my name in they verses, 
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal, 
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill, 
And I think this got this "Making of a Legend" feel, 
Problem with these other niggas they, 
Ain't never real, 
Yea ... that's all I can say.

I’m more than just an option
Hey, Hey, Hey
refuse to be forgotten
Hey, Hey, Hey
I took a chance with my heart
Hey, Hey, Hey
And I feel it taking over


I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I bet if i give all my love then

but give all I have to you and
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I bet if i give all my love then
nothing's gonna tear us apart 

I bet if i give all my love then
nothing's gonna tear us apart

Gotta do what I gotta do


All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting, I told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

 

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone till November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house takin' no calls
I done hit the stride, got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the wri-wri-wri-wri

All aboard, okay, next stop, my basement… ha ha
I'll meet you down there

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Haters getting mad, they done had enough of shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touche me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's a no-no who even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I ought to just be honest but

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert, and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad, when I call them both faggots
It's all these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the weiner schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
Body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him
Homie, I'm the sheisse, pass Doctor Dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussys queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A even got a bidet
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator 



It's not me and you
It's not me it's you
Your reckless and you know it
They don't love you like I do
Say you're moving over, like guess that's just the motion

I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

I don't have a fuck to give
I been moving state to state
In my leather and my Tims
Like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chubb
That's my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
That's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling
'Cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone

But, I guess that's just the motion
And your phone doesn't ring when they got everything
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

Yeah,
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
'Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her
And she know it
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help

But, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh) 

(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.)
Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Drawin' a Blank like
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.

Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma do that for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()

Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
Imeet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

Better watch out sucker now I got ya where I want ya,
onslaught, coming and Im packing in my lunch up,
bunch a missile launcher and a bunch a contra,
van van full of ganja, now come on jump,
man stop marchin marshall on my gotcha,
doin’ the cha cha and the kucharcha with a quadri-plegic,
boogieing down to Frank Sinatra,
Lyndsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya,
who da knew the puda do ta me whats its done,
such cynicism when this isn’t in my system,
blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lip son,
so much on my hands, i got to give my kids a fist pump,
Chris-to-pher Reeves swimming in my swim trunks,
Mister, “help me” whats he said to me and then sunk,
women skinning them and cutting them up in chunks,
in comes the woman with cocoa butter skin ones,


Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-buffalo bill,
skin em up, hym em,
sew em up in those kilts, up in those kilts,
upa upa up in those kilts,
man you don’t want to go up in those hills,
up in those hills, uppa up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill,
buffa-buffalo bill,


Always, you can see em lurking in the hallways,
carcasues of caucasion females in his draw space,
how the hell did he fit em all in such a small space,
hide em in the wall but how long will the dry wall take,
well f-ck it then, I got nothing but time, I’ll wait,
until its dries for the moment i guess your all safe,
after I sand it and buff it I guess that I’ll paint,
my chainsaw’s outta gas my regular saw aint,
now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling,
you can even hear the evil spirits coming from within,
someones in, the back of my damn house rummaging,
its a girl, she looks pretty thin but I want to skin,
been on the hunt again, when will it ever end,
Evelyn why you trying to fight you will never win,
http://www.elyricsworld.com/buffalo_bill_lyrics_eminem.html
severing legs, arms, damn there goes another limb,
pull the lever then trap door, death is evident




Now what you know about Buffalo Bill,
nothing so chill,
f-cking hoe, you better f-cking hold still,
make sure none of that lotion in that bucket don’t spill,
cut em gut em and just keep stuffing those girls,
man I think she had enough of those pills,

sedate her, then I wait her come back later just to clutch on those steel blades
braids, baby when I cut ya dont squeal
I hate the loud noises I f-cking told you,
I keep hearing voices like
wouldn’t you like to go and get ya put ya knife
and push it right through it while ya put ya shishkebab skewer
into a barbecue or would ya do to her what you usually do to a girl who’s skins newer,


In a World of Sin doer this is turning into a torment tournament of sorts,
Christmas Ornament you are,


I”ll be sure to Gensu ya til there’s no more skin to ya,
boo ya who ya think you f-cking with,
duck because here he comes again,



These girls aint got nothing on you
uhh, say baby I had to mention
that if you were a star youd be the one Im searching for
other girls they got attention
but I just always feel like there in need of something you got
obvious you're pretty
heard that your a student working weekends in the city
trying to take you out girl, hope your not too busy
and if theres nothing wrong, got this little song
for you to get ready to
put those f-cking heels on and work it girl
let that mirror show you what your doing
put that f-cking dress on and work it kind of vicious
like somebodys taking pictures


shut it down down down
you would shut it down down down
you be the baddest girl around round round
and they notice they notice
you would shut it down down down
you be the baddest girl around round round
and they notice they notice
you would shut it, hey oh
these girls aint got nothing on you nothing on you

What you need

I can be (I can be)
your everything
(who knew)
them other n-ggas
just wanna hit it but if they had it
wouldnt know what to do with it
(and together)


we shut it down down down
they know we shut it down down down
your the baddest girl around


TMZ concrete loop
you shut that muthf-cker down down
ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
you shut that muthaf-cker down down down
oh yeah,
yes indeed, you shut it down down
Drizzy, The American Dream

You shut that sh-t down
(down down down)
you shut it down
you shut it down
you shut it down
you shut it down
you shut it, ohh

you looking good girl
go go go get em girl,
go go go go hit em girl
go go go go go go
you shut it down

So this is it?
This is what I wished for
This isnt how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just this shit'd be different
But something changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffing it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldnt quit
I just wanted a little bit
Them it turned me to a monster 
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert
I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sowing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no one for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in between
You either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3 years later they go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just aint pass yet
A couple more years that shit'll be illmatic 
And 8 years later I'm still at it
Divorced, remarried
A felon,a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk


So be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold
I said be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might ot know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold

I got a letter from a fan that said
He's been praying for me
Everyday, and for some reason it's been weighing on my mind heavy
Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But some thing told me to go ahead and open it but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you
You didn't pray for me when i was local
And as i lay these vocals
I think of all the shit i had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you atleast a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but i've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride hasn't it?
Just watching it from an opposite stand point
Man boy's got to look... nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now on how
To describe this shit
It's just like  a vibe you get
Go ahead  and bop to it just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit



(uhh, Young Money, Yea)

:
I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last year, who the f**k are yall?
I swear it feels like the last few nights

And this what Ima do til its over
Til its over

1
Bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, f**k are yall thinkin?
Makin sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin
Bout to set it off, set it off in this B**ch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldntve drove, tell me how Im gettin home
You too fine to be layin down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing Ive ever known
Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these n***as
All I needs a f**king red jacket with some zippers
Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers
I did it overnight, it couldnt happen any quicker
Yall know them? Well, f**k it, me either
But point the biggest skeptic out, Ill make him a believer
It wouldnt be the first time I done it, throwin hundreds
When I should be throwin ones, b**ch, I run it (Ah)

One thing bout music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that sh*t that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, its just game
Its just what comes with the fame, and Im ready for that, Im just sayin
But I really cant complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin Ima quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
Im really too young to be feelin this old
Its about time you admit it, who you kiddin, man?
Man, nobodys never done it like I did it (Ugh)

:
I know way too many people here right now

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated
against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,
give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the
evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but
they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...



I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm
cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I
never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me
inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a
multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father
must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,
no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I
couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it
work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm
man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest
shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot
Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...



Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you
think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'
your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'
through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of
Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew
up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made
that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your
gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna
know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but
you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't
admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare
you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in
hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess
what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...



Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And I think it's changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture, the trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagle's, an Aries coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
(Real talk) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ride around his block
All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
Welcome to Detroit, mothafucka

Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D
On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas say
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
And to think y'all hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
I had K's in front ya school, but I ain't go to Kettering
Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son
And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody

Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit

And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me
I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch
180 degrees in here trying to wait for the cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah when it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
Sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it
It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters when you came here?
And I came to kill 'em

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

What up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody
Hey Em let me get that instrumental
Take it down to the hood
Let the little hoodies get this remix crackin'
Detroit

Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
Some shit about a message you left 
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" 
This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! 
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre 
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way) 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch 

So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
We can fly over the border "Let's go" 
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
 (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri 
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste 
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Plus he raps with his regular voice 
 (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys 
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ 
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! 
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
Do somethin'! At least one punchline 
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs 
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither 
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!) 
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Intro] 
Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging 

 
I'm withholding my anger 
Though I'd like to be the strangler 
Of this punkass little pussy's puny neck 
It's my right to insist 
That he acknowledge my existence 
But he just displays complete lack of respect 
That's what he says to himself 
As he uses magazines to trash me 
As he sits with both feet up at his desk 
Smokes a bag of his weed 
And starts imagining things 
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed 
And in his jealousy and envy 
It just whirls him in a frenzy 
As he turns on MTV and sees my face 
He don't exist in this world 
So he just twists and he twirls 
Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a race 
And it's destroying him slowly 
Cuz he does not even know me 
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes 
So he just tortures himself 
He has no fortune and wealth 
So he extorts someone else to get his dough 
And now he's acting like a bully 
So he tries to push and pull me 
But he knows that he can't pull me so he's mad 
He has no choice but to scream 
And raise his voice up at me 
Cuz it annoys him to see that I ain't scared 

 
You aint no motherfucking (bully) 
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking (bully) 
I won't allow it, aint no coward to no (bully) 
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully) 
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...) 

And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...) 

 
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies 
No more unfortunately 
There's so many motherfuckers that just are 
They just keep pounding at me 
Now that I'm down with 50 
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja  
But his ass is such a puppet 
Irv could stick his whole hand up it 
And just make him say what he wants him to say 
But shook-ass Irv's on a string 
And Irv's so nervous that he 
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay 
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough 
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf 
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down 
But our building's made out of bricks 
So you ain't taking out shit 
I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown 
So now you try to pull a race car 
And it backfires in your face hard 
Cuz you know we don't play that black and white shit 
Plus this guy that you fucked 
When you was ecstasied up 
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch 

 
You must be taking to much (E...) 

 
Now what bothers me the most 
About hip-hop is we so close 
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac 
We just lost Jam Master J 
Big L got blasted away 
Plus we lost Bugs, Slayed Son, and Freaky Ta 
It's like a never-ending cycle 
That just seems to come full circle 
Everyone's gotta be so fucking hard 
I'm not excluding myself 
Cuz I been stupid as well 
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart 
But as we grow as men 
We learn to let shit go, but then again 
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand 
We all got reps to uphold 
When someone steps on our toes 
It's no exception, it goes for every man 
But if Irv really gave a fuck 
About Ja like he claims he does 
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs 
But he just keeps feeding him pills 
So if that E doesn't kill him 
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed 
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight 
If the situation escalates 
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game 
And if I get killed for this rap 
I got a million in cash 
That says I will get you back in Halie's name 

 
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...) 

 
Get at me, dawg 
Holla

Come on hey hey we goin' to the beach 
grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat. 
Where's Mama? 
She's takin' a little nap in the trunk 
Oh that smell dada must have run over a skunk. 
now I know what you're thinkin': 
it's kind of late to go swimmin' 
but you know your mama she's one of those types of women 
who does crazy things and if she don't get her way she'll throw a 
fit 
don't play with daddy's toy knife, honey, let go of it 
and don't be so upset, why you actin' bashful? 
don't you wanna help dadda build a sand castle? 
and mama said she wants to show how far she can float, 
and don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat 
it's just a little scratch it don't hurt, 
her was eatin' dinner while you was sleepin' and spilled ketchup on 
her shirt 
mama's messy, isn't she, we'll let her wash off in the water 
and me and you can play by ourselves, can't we? 
just the two of us (sung) repeat 8-9 times 
there's a place called heaven and a place called hell, 
a place called prison and a place called jail, 
and dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one, 
'cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson 

and you don't want a brother do ya? (Na) 
maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better, I'll 
explain it to ya. 
but for now we'll just say that mama was real, real bad 
she was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad 
but I still feel sad that I put her in time out, 
sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin' to climb out 
I told you it's okay, hey hey, wanna baba? 
take a night-night, nana-boo, goo-goo ga-ga 
humma goo-goo caca, dad'll change your dighty, 
clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty. 
you're dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water, 
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter. 
just the two of us (sung) 
wake up sleepy head we're here, 
before we play, we're gonna take mama for a little walk along the 
pier. 
baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea, 
mama's too sleepy to hear you screamin' in her ear, 
that's why you can't get her to wake, 
but don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mama at the bottom of the 
lake, 
here, you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock? 
we'll tie it to her footsies then will roll her off the dock. 
ready now, here we go, on the count of three, 
one, two, three...weeeeeeeeee 
there goes mama splashin' in the water, 
no more fightin' your dad, no more restrainin' order, 
no more step dada, no more new brother, 
blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her, 
we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk, 
but first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk, 
just the two of us (sung)




(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
> Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will serve you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?


(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right


(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right
Aw Yeah

How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself "why do you hurt me?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know that you love me baby
Time to take you away from me...
Only over my dead body...


I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Mmm, mmm
F*ck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some 
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from

Yeah, you know me well nigga, yeah 
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the p-ssy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yea
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again 
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine 
And I be hearing sh*t you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yea
It's been that way from the beginning I just been playing, I aint even notice that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright


I know, I know that you love me baby
The time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body


You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And f-ck you to the niggas that thinks it's there time, yea
Don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever gave you a star boy
Or you wanna be a mother fuckin' funny guy
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart boy
Yea, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel now more than ever
My city love me like I'm Mac Dre in The Bay
Second Album I'm pack paving away
The backpackers are back on the band wagon like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby's mom last night
We took a picture Last night
I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And lost everything that I came with
Yea, feel like I've been here before
I still got 10 years to go, ha
And this is the only sound you should fear
And these kids where crowns over here & everything is alright...





Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black, white or a albino yeah
You can have corn rows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go *blah
From outta nowhere, you might find your career
Come to an *err and I'm just like (Oh Yeah)

Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let em talk shit, cause they talk shit
Knowing deep down, they really just wanna squash it
Cause no one wants to walk around, stepping in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum'
We just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm
Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiya'
Meanwhile your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
Right in the ass with KY, yes sir!
So full of joy, boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you
'Yea boi don't curr'



See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)

The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is dogg, man life's not fair
Ya friend should've know not to front round here
Listen kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear
They'll strip yo ass of your jewels, right here
Man I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
Ya girl's a freak, man sometime we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You prolly heard about me, I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin, like I'm running for mayor
riding, winding, dining and shining, know what I'm saying
I ain't got time for fucking around, and horseplaying
I'm making hits, my homies taking hits, who's staying

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to pick it
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch


Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long


We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) shake your body


Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khaki's pressed, Nike shoes just crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made Em just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in dang, bang bang
Yes sir Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang dang
P-p-p-pow chicka pow chicka wow wow
Got your gal blowin' up a val-v-v-v-val-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now hoe




We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) get your vials




And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard, drugs are though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you a loan, car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers, shit head with a potty mouth
Get the bar soap lathered, Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl you’re fixin' to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd man
You birdbrain baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you’re a swallow
Word, Rick word man you heard, but don’t be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam





Just the two of us.. 


Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us..

Rrrr Ting

I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy, get hurt, boy
Aww, here go another mo'fucker that don't understand
The concept of puttin' money first, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You too worried 'bout the bitches
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it
She'll admit it, she'll admit it
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy
Shit hot up in the 6 right now, shit hot up in the 6, boy
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now
Come see us and get it fixed, boy
Black Benz on the road, boy, already had a Rolls Royce
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys
I give a fuck about old boy
I give a fuck about his squad, boy
I give a fuck about your mob, boy
I'm the real 6 God, boy
I'm about to say a true thing
I'm about to say a true thing
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
God damn, you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this
I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now


You still love me?
Take this. 
You ready? 1.. 2.. 3! 


The more you, put me through,
The more it makes me wanna come back to you,
You say you hate me, I just love you more,
You don't want me, I just want you more,
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
I know it's sad but it's making me happy,
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
Cause you love me, and I love you more.


It's sick, but who could ever predict,
We'd be doin' the same shit,
We say we do it for our baby but we don't,
We do it for us, it's lust,
Cause neither one of us trusts each other,
So we fuck 'til we bust,
Then we cuss each other, out,
We know what it's about,
Shout 'til I throw you out the house,
You throw me out the house,
I throw you on the couch,
Punch you in the mouth,
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,
And apologize after,
Laughter, pain, it's insane,
We're back in the same chapter again,
And it's sad but it's true,
When I'm layin' here with you,
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.




Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,
It makes me wanna just take you,
And just throw you on the bed,
And fuck you like I don't even know you,
You fuck other people, and I fuck other people,
You a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,
We're both evil in our ways,
But neither one of us would ever admit it,
Cause one of us would have one up on the other,
So forget it,
We can make accusations, people spread rumors,
But they ain't got proof,
'Til they do it's just the two of us,
It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me,
But you gotta believe me to a degree,
Cause true indeed if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,
Yeah I would cause the sex is too damn good,
If I ran who would I run to,
That would be this soft and warm,
So it's off and on, usually more off than on,
But at least we know that we share this common bond,
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on,
I hope, the only reason that I cope,
Is cause of that fact,
And plus I can bust in that,
And that's why...




I could never understand it,
That's why I don't try,
From junior high until we both die,
It's silly ho why must we try,
Is it really so rough,
That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,
Try to pull each other's legs,
Until the other begs,
We're liein' to ourselves,
That's the beauty of it yeah,
Cause we truly love each other,
That's why we always fight,
And all we do is shove each other,
Every other fuckin' night,
And it's clear it ain't gonna change,
It's pent up rage,
We both have,
We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,
We've both been,
Someone else's someone else,
Problem is neither one wants help,
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed,
Our family's mixed up,
There's a baby sister in the mix,
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,
On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,
All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,
But I won't be made a fool of,
If this is true love,
You wouldn't do what,
You did last time,
You wouldn't screw up,
This time,
Cause this time girl,
I'm telling you what,
You do it again I'm fucking you up,
No matter what...


What you say, what you do,
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,
No matter where you run, I'll be right there,
Right behind you, in your nightmares,
All the flowers, and the candy,
All the times that you threw it back at me,
You told me you hate me, you're gonna hate me more,
When you find out, can't escape me whore.



You know a lotta girls be...thinking my songs about them, but
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...


Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say you da fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate,
Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the matt and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

Cause,



Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffin theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had

Remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby


I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25 sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?


One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt?
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

 


It’s like I'm in the dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won’t work
All it takes is one song on the radio you’re right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burned, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don’t suppose an explanation I’m owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I’d never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
'bout to go through’s tougher than anything I have suffered
Can’t think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"


I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy


And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pain of resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you?
The cause to my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone




I've been driving around your side of the town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders before hand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost half of a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back as they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it we are in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by Eminem
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
(Help, police!!)
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, hope you can swim good!
Now say you hate homos again!


I also represent anyone normally seen on the end of these jokes of a beat
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Backs to the wall, I’m stacking up all them odds, toilets cock
Yeah ‘cause I’m talking a lot of shit but I’m backing it all up
But in my head there’s a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I’m the ringing in your ears
I’m the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I’m your time that’s almost up that you haven’t acknowledged
Grab for some water but I’m that pill that’s too jagged to swallow
I’m the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult there
With the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mather’s the rapper’s persona’s have a facade and 
Matthew and Stan’s just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it’s gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them,
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don’t stop after they call you
The biggest laughing stock of rap who can’t call it quits
But it’s time to walk away
I’m ever guilt trip the baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time, I’m back
Before it fades into black and it’s all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers’ left off



Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh-t
When I hear talkin, I just dont know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams who Im racing with
You can see Im pacin it so that Im always chasin it
Wayne put me right here, thats who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own, but its lookin like July 4th
But I just wish theyd let you try it first
This time Im really goin off, fireworks



When I go off like July 4th
feels like a fire, Got to go higher
Its your revelation, my sweet celebration
light me like a rocket, cause can't nothing stop it
all I see is fireworks,
all i see is fireworks
every night its fireworks
every night its fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off like fireworks


I got this one girl, you know, in my life
so I say in this song, I say
I'm just such a gentleman
you should give it up for me
look at how I'm placing al my napkins and my cutlery
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you f-ck with me
who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me
yeh, I kept my wits about me luckilly
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
and you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
but I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
what an experience
you coulda been the one but it wasnt that serious
their was smoke in the air before now its me cleaing it
that felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
now I can see it in her eyes
Fireworks!

 


Everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that I still listen
and he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my Realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city I let her explore
ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close
yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first, that's why I'm really going off, Fireworks!

When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
If I die all I know is I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way
Money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'on't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'mma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D, I'm the holy one
Yeaaah, you know wassup
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong


I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdose on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it,(aye) please don't do it,(aye) cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,


Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind.
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize it happened over time
She says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you suppose to do
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions.
You know the game even got it like that.
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that.
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind (mind, mind, mind)
Tell em' I apologize it happened over time (time, time, time)
They know

Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who"
And she like, "who are we kidding? You're 27, you just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me ,momma
What more they want from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough
Ir making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life




I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy


Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal


Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, "Baby girl, fall in line, " ok
Made a million, off of denim
Fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "I'll nigga alert! I'll nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)




I touched down in '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with' us and we don't fuck with' y'all, it's no different over on this side
God damn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, "You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help"
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,
Ya'll keep talking 'bout who next,
But I'm about how big as it gets,
I swear ya'll just wastin' ya'll breath,
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,
I'm a make it last forever,
It's not your time 'cause I ain't done yet,
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,
I was made for all of this shit,
And I'm on the road box office sales,
I'm getting paid for all of this shit,
Ask you to please excuse my table manners,
I was making room for the table dancers,
'Cause if we judging off your advances,
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!




HOE, SHUT THE fuck UP
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rest do
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythang
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit
Good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth
Drink a fifth
Load the nine
Leave you split, in the half
Smoke a half, Need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me
And I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'
Lil' bitch


Oh Me. Oh Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that, that ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)
I'm blessed than a motherfucker,
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin' nervous, clutchin' they chests like a motherfucker,
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail,
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man,
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do. 


Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Yeah
Too late
I cant keep chasing em
Taking my life like that
Caught in a change
25 to life


I dont think she understands the sacrifices that I made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I wouldve stayed
But ive already wasted over half of my life I wouldve laid
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
Imma take control of this relationship
Command it, and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while ive stayed
Faithfull all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I aint heard you yet
Not even once say you apreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so dont hold your fucking breath
You know what youve done no need to go in depth
I told you, youd be sorry if I fucking left
Id laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny aint it, you neglected me
Did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but its,


Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life


I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that aint good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Till I snap
Dont think im loyal
All I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Dont I give you enough of my time
You dont think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why im married to you still man I dont know
But tonight im serving you with papers
Im divoricing you
Go marry someone else and make em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat em like you dont need them and they aint worthy of you
Feed em the same shit that you made me eat
Im moving on forget you oh,
Now im special, I aint felt special when I was with you
All I ever felt was dissed
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
Its ridiculus
And still I stick with this
Im sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Your addicive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away from
Im addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
Im drawn to this, so I guess imma mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time imma
Aint changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abiss
You screaming as I walk out that ill be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop
Im leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And its just


Too late for the other side
Caught in a change
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a change
25 to life
Too late
Caught in a change
25 to life


Worst...


Mothafucka never loved us, fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now, still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions, nigga we don't know shit
Flexing! Nigga, I'm just flexing
Nigga never loved us, do it look like we stressing?
Look at you, look at you and look at you, aww, I'm glad that they chose us
Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish, just to see if I'm finished


On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us... Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up?
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior


Hold up, hold my phone, mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us, now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us, so everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up! You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B




Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothing changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm coming back on my worst behavior


Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior


Things been so crazy and hected
I should of have got back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better any how...


So if you gotta go
If there's anythin I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you looking for a purpose


You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm all singing karaoke, further than I ever been


So if you gotta go...
If there's anyway I can help


Isn't it ironic,
That the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
And tell's me my life is to much and moves to atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you would choose some where that had somebody that you know
I'm alway's up to late
I worry bout you there alone in a place you call your home warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy cause no man wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest but the first cut is the deepest
I tryed to keep us together you was busy keeping secrets
Secrets you would tell everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money
I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm suprise you couldn't tell


I was only trying to get ahead 
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And your looking for a purpose


I was only trying to get ahead 
But the spotlight makes you nervous...

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause


They loving the crew


Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'mma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know




Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
(If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city)
TRACK 4 ON TAKE CARE

"Morning, Marshall."
"Morning, doc."
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
"Anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. 
Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"
"Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back"
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."
"Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and 
it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, 
we know you're a busy person."
"But I thought variety was the most important thing?"
"So what else are you thinking?"
"Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, 
and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."
"Steps?"
"Yeah, steps."
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?
"Well, twelve."
"Christ, I don't even know them all."
"Really?"
"Anything else?"
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, 
what do I do if I find myself in a situation where 
maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I 
get tempted to?"
"Take a drink."
"What?"
"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."
"Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink 
I already know what that's gonna lead me to."
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
"Man, what the fuck!?"
"Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? 
Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. 
We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall...? Marshall!?
"No, no, no, no, NO!"

You know a lotta girls be...thinking my songs about them, but
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...


Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say you da fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate,
Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the matt and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

Cause,



Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffin theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 

Uhh, ah yea
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money
You know who you are, I got ya

 ()
This sh-t was all I knew,
you and me only,
and I did it all for you,
still you were lonely,
we coulda worked it out,

uhh, but i guess things change,
its funny how someone elses success brings pain,
when ya no longer involved that person has it all,
and you just stuck standing there,

But, Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,
Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,


Yeah,
ever since Ive been long gone,
I traded in my senorita for a microphone,
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see,
your life is good but me and you its catastrophe,
if I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied,
I need a paramedic girl, Im feeling paralysed,
if I could choose, you will always be a friend to me,
the more money I made you acting like my enemy,
its crazy, I cant help it if you feel ashamed,
lots of pressure will turn you into my diamond babe,
how can something so familiar be so strange,
closest friends get estranged when the status change,
ahh, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at,
and my whole wild is the only one that had my back,
you were the perfect girl, now it seems we dont match,
is it the money, want me to give it back,




Uhh, i am the topic of conversation, this a celebration,
lets toast to the fact that I moved out my momma basement,
to a condo downtown because its all about location,
I sit and drink wine and watch californication of life,
you shoulda been here to kick it with me,
we coulda split this whole thing up 50/50,
but now im at the 40/40 getting b-tches tipsy,
killing sh-t the ever so talented Mr Ripley,
how I go from being the man that you argue with,
to me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest sh-t,
I should wanna go back to the one I started with,
but Im addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit,
yeah, just ask me how things are coming along,
you can tell me that you never heard none of my songs,
long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen,
cos whats a star when its most important fan is missing?

and a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
and i fall in love with girls caught up with superficial glamour
who dress like sarah jessica
and live like princess diana
so often they have addictions
and im the one that'll feed it
but truely you're bad enough that you dont even really need it
you can show up at the party on dirty public transit
and i guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin candids
of you and your posse partying
drinking watch you get handed
with your virgin island tans
all lookin like you just landed
i dont really understand it
im not sure im comprehending it
but these girls are having fun with whoevas money they spendin

Boomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm... (Louuuu)
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work a night shift

Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift

Young, but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Louuuu)

If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I'm never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me


Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)
My name is Shaaady
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)


You see that chick in the gym checking me out?
Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a (-I'll)? and I'm wrecklessly wrecking the house
That was suppose to be wreckless, where the heck is it now?
Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of your couch
Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'Open Sesame' mouth
Down the hatchet, the feeling, you can't match it
A rap-tap-tap on your door with the damn wratchet
A tat-tac-tac in the hall with the damn hatchet
A nap-sack-packed with like 40-some Zan-exs
Shorty come back, I'm tryin to score me some lapdances
I'm bout to relapse so maybe pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula 40-40 and 40s with mad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya


Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And are you menstruating baby, my lil friend's waiting to say Hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin like Jello
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello


My equilibrium is off, must me the Lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday extracurriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
51 people asleep in my damn living room
Scuse me hun? But what is your name, Liddy-young?
I want up next to ya naked and uh, did we umm?
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the fact that you, I'm cool, I immediately run like Speedy Gon-
Zalez to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum


Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And do you happen to have anything on you that make my mood mellow?
Some are open and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello


Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurtin me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)
I second that and a third, rush to emergency sur-
-gery to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purged
He's sees the loner getting the three-hundred bucks for these Perc-agains
Buster's getting to be where he lustfully surged it in
Pain it hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin him'
Childishly on the phone tryin to rustle up muscle relax-
-ants for his back and a couple of packs
Since now he's doubling back-wards and he stumblin back
Slipped and fell, hit his back-bone, heard something go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm bustin a rap
Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it, I'm back



And so I'm sayin...


Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)
My name is Shaaady
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen, you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soul mate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you

She said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

These days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

She says kiss you like miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
ANd when you're fuckinq someone else
just fuck her like she aint me

Damn those words are scary
those words are scary virqin mary 
I just tell her to spare me
I was in 

When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)


I know way too many people here right now that I didn’t know last year
who the fuck are y’all
I swear it feels like the last few nights we’ve been everywhere and back
but I just can’t remember it all
what am I doing, what am I doing
oh yeah that's right, I’m doing me, I’m doing me
I’m living life right now man
and this what I’m do til its over
til it’s over, it’s far from over


alright, bottles on me
long as I’m a drink it
never drop the ball, fuck y’all thinking
making sure the young money ship is never sinking
bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldn’t have drove, tell me how I’m getting home
you too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I’ve ever known
got to go thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
all I need is a fucking red jackets with some zippers
super good smiddoke a package of the swishas
I did it over night, it couldn’t happen any quicker
y’all know them, but fuck it me either
but point the biggest skeptic out I’ll make them a believer
it wouldn’t be the first time I’ve done it throwing hundreds
when I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ahh,




Uhhh,
one thing 'bout music when it hits you feel no pain
and I swear I got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
so they tell me that they love me I know better than that it’s just game
it’s just what comes with the flame
and I’m ready for that I’m just saying
but I really can’t complain, everything is kosher
two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
I really can’t see the end getting any closer
but I’ll probably still be the man when everything is over
so I’m riding through the city with my high beams on
can you see me can you see me get your visine on
y’all just do not fit the picture
turn your widespread on
if you thinking Imma quit before I die dream on
man they treat me like a legend
am I really this cold
I’m really too young to be felling this old
it’s about time you admit it who you kidding man
nobody’s ever done it like I did it
ahh
(chorus)

Here I go. Im a rapper turned singer. And you can tell that he smoke, but I don't need my vocal cords all I hit is C-Notes.
N.E.R.D flow, i spaz if im prevoked
I'm about to change the fuckin game, pass the re-mote.
Money is everythang, and its every other thing.
I'm part of the choir, its the motto that my brotha sang.
Cash is the right now, women are the post game.
Money-over-bitches dot com check the domain.
It's comin too soon, album on the way.
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon.
Oops I mean a red moon... I did it again to 'em.
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation.
I say, heavy metaphors, flow so over weight.
I can rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake.
Frost bite drizzy nigga, no body as cold as Drake.
Keep yo ass in-line, don't be tryin to roller skate.
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit.
I am twenty-one tell me who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real cause I'm getting hood lovin I ain't even talkin' street shit.
Young angel, young lyin and I'm done tryin.
I'm just doin, who's drinkin cause I'm buyin.
It's on meee, everything is on meee.
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin john B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet.
This is for all the stripper cause I know that they gonna bump it tellem back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it.
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear.
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year.
Text brackets and back and forth faxes
My money comin full circle, get up on my axis.
Maybe Imma kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest.
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles and a booth.
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience cause I want it to make sense.

White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness. DRAKE!

Wayne: Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes. And they might even say you should leave me alone.
Homie scared. Cause they just like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy.
Just like Shaggy I toat dat boom bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck bout ya'll
I ain't talkin moths but you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm falling but up I fall and if ya bitch in heat she can fuck my dog.
I went from penny pinchin to private planes.
Never sat on any benches, I got in games.
Starter carter ball harder, ten girls penthouse suit ya'll order.
Whatever ya'll please. wine crackers and cheese.
They take off their clothes and put on my t's.
This supplement im on got me feeling mighty
My gun and money don't split call that shit Siamese.
My watch make the frickin' time freeze.
Yah girl bless me she suck my dick when I sneeze.
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need.
And eighteen G's is why the chicken cross the street.
Whatchya know about it my niggas so about it.
If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it.
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer.
Got the shoty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me.
Im a bad boy obviously, pop one at your ivy league
I dont have a rivalry if so you will have a casualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually.
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering.
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery.
You got short salary, and I got long money, I got cash money, I got young money. bitch...

Dj Drama: See I told ya'll it'd be well worth the wait right

Lyrics © Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group

"Morning, Marshall."
"Morning, doc."
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
"Anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. 
Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"
"Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back"
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."
"Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and 
it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, 
we know you're a busy person."
"But I thought variety was the most important thing?"
"So what else are you thinking?"
"Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, 
and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."
"Steps?"
"Yeah, steps."
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?
"Well, twelve."
"Christ, I don't even know them all."
"Really?"
"Anything else?"
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, 
what do I do if I find myself in a situation where 
maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I 
get tempted to?"
"Take a drink."
"What?"
"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."
"Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink 
I already know what that's gonna lead me to."
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
"Man, what the fuck!?"
"Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? 
Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. 
We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall...? Marshall!?
"No, no, no, no, NO!"

ssss Shady aftermath
G-Unit! Haha

()
Cause we came here to set this party off right
let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in thru the front we'll come thru the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without a least sayin' good bye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right scream one last time.

Get your ass up for the Doctor
One more time Get your ass up for the Doctor
come on now, here we go
cliffhanger it's another club banger
got you hangin on the edge of your seat
get on down

Time's up, game's over, you lose i win
bout to show these knuckle heads how to do this here
oooh yeah, new year
next phase begin
look who's got you goin crazy again
i'm a trend, i set one every time i'm in
i go out and just come back in full circle again
if you a fad that means it's something that we already had
but once your gone you don't come back
too bad you're off the map now
radar can't even find you
we stay on the grind
you slip we out grind you
you walk around mad you let your anger blind you
we walk around just playin the violin behind you
enough with all the pissin and moanin, whinin and bitchin
sit observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
why i'm sittin multi-platinum, later 3 diamond worldwide
we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin

(chorus)

When Dr. Dre says "Crunk!"  you will get it crunk (get it crunk, crunk, crunk)
and when 50 Cent says "Jump!" you will get on one foot and jump! (jump, jump, jump)
Applause is tremendous , we drop you all the senses
i don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
we keep the party rockin off the hinges
we ain't showin off we're just goin off popular consensus
but critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all washed up
knock it off! Who the fuck is Doc impressin?
Doc is this, Doc is that
you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cockadock cause Doc left you all guessin
so DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?)
we gonna have this muthafucka hoppin in a second (uh huh)
that's why we always save the best cut last
to make the scratch and mix for it like fresh cut glass
We swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
spoke to an generation of angry teenagers whom if it wasn't for rap
to bridge the gap may be raised to be racists
who may have never got to see our faces
grace the cover of Rollin Stone pages
broke down barriers of language and races
just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
to pass the mic don't need ta play back and forth like 
the hot potato game or somethin

()

50 Cent come on!
Now snap, hands up
you know how we do, we make the club jump everywhere we go
it's no secret, everybody know 
when Dre's involved there's plenty of money involved 
and plenty honeys involved 
it's sunny Sundays and palm trees, Cali
every day is just another party from The Valleys
all the way to the "make my" alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the Grand Finale
now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
blaze a pound of weed 6 days about the week
you can catch me in the studio bangin out the beatsta
provide ya with the heat that keep blazin out the speakers 
so never say never cause Shady Aftermath together along with G-Unit 
records presents the return of the "The Doc" (O'Shay)
no one can do it better we tear that club up and leave without a shred of evidence
and a...

()

yeah! haha Still Aftermath 2006!
And don't worry bout that Detox Album... it's comin! 
We gonna make Dre do it. Ha ha! 
50 Cent  G-Unit

*
Yeah
I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time, like
What it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then, but
I can probably tell you a lil somethin' now


Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin', I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels and they silencin' you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here
I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch chrome green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years
It's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap
It's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' dranks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like (vocalizes)
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring 07
Second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is whack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at the dinner table and say "my baby's famous and I knew it"
Find More lyrics at www.sweetslyrics.com
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I'm drawin' and drawin' till the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out


Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF


Closer to my dreams (Miss Andreena Mill)
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah (Yeah man)
I feel it in my sleep (Sing it to 'em baby)
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams


Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progress
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video has made everything right with ex (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Too many rappers and not enough-
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
They can't
Play pen drop out
The gray ten drop out
Summer 05 with the gray Benz drop out
Charcoal charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the awful dodger
Showed her I'mma
I told her I'mma
Bout to get my run-on so hold the commas
Times changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home



Closer to my dreams 
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah 
I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks
Hit me when you done your shift
Wooh, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what?
I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky
I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me
Someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-the-strippin-shit"
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me
I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect
She's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog

Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift
I need some company
I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company

Mo City trip! Mo City trip right now!
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
A Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now

It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
Tour 'round the city, it's the shit right now
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Pop a couple percs let's get it in right now
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now
Call up your girl and put them heels on
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now
I'm on a Mo City trip
I'm a dog
I'ma dog, I'm in heat baby...heat baby
I'm a dog.....
I go ham, I'm a hog
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off
What she get in to, when we take it off
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions
Do you mind if we just menage just a little?

Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now


Hi! My name is.. (what?) My name is.. (who?)
My name is..  Slim Shady
Hi! My name is.. (huh?) My name is.. (what?)
My name is..  Slim Shady

Ahem.. excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?


Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Ummmm..)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh! "So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!




My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Owwwwwwww!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians
In a space ship while they screaming at me: "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans (Aaahhhhhh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!'




Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive (Huh yup!)
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? (WAH!)
YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS! (WAHHH!)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (BANG!)
I'm steaming mad (Arrrggghhh!)
And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had



Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit ain’t my fault, girl cause I'm lonely

Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody’s house that you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it, I’m not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae

This shit ain’t my fault

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated
against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,
give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the
evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but
they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...



I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm
cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I
never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me
inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a
multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father
must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,
no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I
couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it
work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm
man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest
shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot
Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...



Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you
think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'
your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'
through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of
Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew
up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made
that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your
gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna
know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but
you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't
admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare
you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in
hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess
what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...

Lyrics © Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group



I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
I faced her around
But his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His bridges, he out grow'd em


Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand,
Someone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm, you prick
You call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder
You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me
See he's in a whole nother weight class
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets
You're full of it; you were just in his CD's
Left at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E

I'm haunted I'm dead your gone

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oooooh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it 

{verse 1}
all niqht i've, been starin'
can you tell i want you ?
can't be too, wide open
but there's nothin, i won't do
ohhh... just want  you to know

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

{verse 2}
I wish i... wasn't famous
I wish i... was still in school
So that i can have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you crazy

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious


{fadey fade away.... lls .}

I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock


She got the good good
She Michael Jackson bad
Im attracted to her
For her attractive ass
And now we murders
Because we kill time
I knock her lights out
And she still shine
I hate to see her go
But I love to watch her leave
But I keep her runnin back and forth
Like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day
Hot as a summers eve
Young money thieves
Steal your heart with ease


I like the way you walkin
If your walkin my way
Im that red bull
Now lets fly away
Lets buy a place
With all kinds of space
Ill let you be the judge
And Im the case
Im Gudda Gudda
I put her under
I see me with her
No Stevie wonder
She dont even wonder
Cuz she know she bad
And I got her n*gger
Grocery bag

[Young Lloyd)
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby

I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock


Okay I get it

I Love ya tosha roll
Hotter than wasabi

Shake and bake
Ricky Bobby

But I cant meet you in the lobby
Girl I gotta watch my back
Cuz Im not just anybody
I seen them stand in line
Just to get beside her
I let her see the aston
And let the rest surprise her
Thats when we disappear
You need GPS to find her
Oh that was your girl?
I thought I recognized her


Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me Mr. Flinestone
I can make your bed rock

She like tanning
I like staying in
She like romancing
I like rollin with friends
She said Im caged in
I think her conscience is
she watching that oxygen
Im watching ESPN
But when that show ends
She all over my skin
Lotion
Slow emotions
Roller coastin
Like back and forth
Hold it
She pose like its for posters
And I poke like Im suppose to
Take this photo if you for me
she said dont you ever show this
Im to loyal and to focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this she rejoiced this
She said your words gets me open
So I closed it where your clothes
Im only lovin for the moment


She aint got a man
But she not alone
Miss. Independent
Yeah she got her own
Hey gorgeous
Um, I mean flawless
Well, thats what your are
How I see it is how I call it
Look at how she walk
Mhm she know she bad
Do your thing baby
I aint even mad
And I aint even fast
Imma stay a while
Hold your head Chris
Imma take her down
(Young Lloyd)
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left.
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Nights over goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's dumb enough out there I blind fold her,
She still comes back to my crib, Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But i wont buy her a soda Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of fritos I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would i buy you a gay ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Man TIP told me on this hoe tip
Best tip I could give you to hip you
Never let these traits trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, shit
Dig you a hole
Take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, its you, but fuck it TIP, it's cool
I'm chillin like a Villain
Like the penguin in it's fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
before I tie a fucking knot I'd tie you in one bitch
you think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger although a nickle might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
there's a bombshell, scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was some motherfucking stud
Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way fo shizzle
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slot checks stob bizzle
So fuck scissors these checkers are bust like a blood blister


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP
And each one thinks "Say this shit"
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, put a sticky note to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gonna tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote 

Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
Some shit about a message you left 
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" 
This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! 
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre 
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way) 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch 

So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
We can fly over the border "Let's go" 
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
 (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri 
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste 
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Plus he raps with his regular voice 
 (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys 
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ 
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! 
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
Do somethin'! At least one punchline 
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs 
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither 
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!) 
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', ain't no tellin'

Suitcase, I been livin' out a suitcase
Still drinkin' Henny, if it's done, I'll take the D'usse
Oops, aye, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
True say, I been goin' hard, but then again
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in, man
I got a blunt, can I get a light?
Yeah, I took the summer off to get it right
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Niggas like "you took the summer off? we couldn't tell"
Dawg, just bought a island, gotta sail to it
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it somebody gotta do it
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it

Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
The shit was gettin' too predictable
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah
I mean we hear about the money you been gettin'
We just never seen a visual
It's our year (aw yeah), Aw yeah
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)
What's the word these days?
Buncha' niggas chasing after all these woman they don't even know (WOOO)
Buncha' out of season woman
Fuckin' off-season niggas to get last season wardrobe (WOOO)
All the rappers that you vouch for
Need to get out of the house more, they washed up
And even if the team was religious with it
I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, naw (WOOO)

OVO, Unruly
One shot to make it in a life
From the six to the fucking 876

I gotta keep watchin' for oppers 'case anything's possible, yeah
There's no code or ethics out here, anyone will take shots at you, yeah
Niggas think they can come take what I got, let's be logical, yeah
V-Live, I order that Alfredo pasta then eat in the kitchen like i'm in the mafia
Houston, they get me though
European, my vehicle
How much it hit me fo'?
Ain't no tellin', yeah
What am I willin' to give her to get what I want tonight?
Ain't no tellin'
Please don't speak to me like I'm that Drake from four years ago
I'm at a higher place
Thinkin' they lions and tigers and bears, I go huntin'
Put heads on my fire place, oh my
Take time, ain't no tellin'
Oh my, ain't no tellin'

 Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

 Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see


Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right 
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
We elevated to new heights premeditated 
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate 
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance 
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop 
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know


So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

 Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see


So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack 


So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become

Attention all units, attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
He could be coming at your girlfriend next


There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him unmercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone


Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


I’m going through changes
I’m going through changes


Lately I really, feel like I’m rolling for like Philly,
I feel like I’m losing control of myself,
I sincerely apologize if all that I sound like, is I’m complaining,
But life keeps on complicating, an’ I’m debating,
On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls,
Can see I’m grievin’, I try and hide it,
But I can’t, why do I act like I’m all high and mighty,
When inside, I’m dying, I am finally realizing I need help.
I can’t do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I’ve been having ups and downs,
Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying,
Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here.
I’m hatin’ my reflection, I walk around the house tryin’ to fight mirrors,
I can’t stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie,
I’m afraid if I close my eyes I might see her,
Shit…




I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin’ at noon,
Yeah dad’s in a bad mood, he’s always snappin’ at you.
Marshall what happened at you, you can’t stop with these pills,
And you’ve fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughin’ at you.
It become a problem you’re too pussy to tackle, get up,
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled.
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed,
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust,
Nah, it ain’t like Doody to do that,
He wouldn’t fuckin’ shoot at, no-body, he fights first,
But dwellin’ on it only makes the night worse,
Now I’m poppin Vic’s, perks and Methadone pills.
Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it,
Fuckin’ drug dealers hang around me like “yes man”,
And they gon’ do whatever I says when, I says it,
It’s in their best interest to protect their investment.
And I just lost my fuckin’ best friend, so fuck it, I guess then…



Don’t know what I’m gonna do,
but I just keep on going through changes


My friends can’t understand this new me,
That’s understandable man, but think how bananas you’d be,
You’d be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.
And everybody’s lookin’ at you, what you want me to do,
I’m startin’ to live like a recluse and the truth is,
Fame startin’ to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low.
I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin’ the same damn DVD,
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive.
And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin’ pills’ll make me feel alright.
And if I’m still awake in the middle of the night,
I just take a couple more, yeah you’re motherfuckin’ right,
I ain’t slowin’ down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, dole em out,
Daddy, don’t you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground.
Fuck, don’t I know the sound of that voice,
Yeah baby hold me down.




Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow I’m pullin’ through.
Swear when I come back I’ma be bulletproof.
I’ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few,
Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth.
Shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?
I think about the things I would never got to say to you,
I’d never get to make it right, so here’s what I came to do.
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too,
I still love your mother, that’ll never change,
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together.
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it,
But I swear on everything, I’d do anything for her on anyday.
There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains,
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn’t any pain.
But I can’t pretend there ain’t, I ain’t placin’ any blame,
I ain’t pointin’ fingers, heaven knows I never been a saint.
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history,
But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say,
I miss you self consciously, wish it didn’t end this way.
But I just had to get away, don’t know why,
I don’t know what else to say, I guess I’m…



Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach

I'm in Miami
I need to call up Miss Cassidy
My name is party, not participation
Sorry for the miscommunication
I need a drink and some tequila with you
You know what I'm trying to do
Hey, let's pop the E off at Liv
I've got some time here to blow
I've got the money to blow
I've got the money and blow
Don't have to guess how I know
Oh, it's a secret just for me, I'll keep it
You old niggas boring as bones
You put the PARTY tape on
You know what's going on
You know what's going on
She keep it wet like tsunami
She think she sunk the Titanic
I get her hot like Wasabi
She think it's wavy and gnarly
I think I'mma pop one for you
Drink one for you

Still in Miami
Most of these girls are too messy
I've got to do some reflecting
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction
I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like brrrrr
I'm on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type
I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight
PND ain't with the ray tay, you know Jay Wray
Got girls here going way way way way way way
Sauga city trip the pay day
Glo'd up off a gate way, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in their feelings these days
All in their feelings these days
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes
You should be afraid

I'm preaching, oooh
Preaching
Preaching, babe
Preaching, whooo
I'm a finally, finally
Yeah

You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ooww Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you’ve all been waiting for ..
In this corner : weighing 175 pounds,
with a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,
the undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world :
Slim Shady!

 : Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don’t act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh Uh-oh, bitch3s hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where’s the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I notice there’s so many of them
and there’s really not that many of us.
And ladies love us, my posse’s kicking up dust.
It’s on till the break of dawn
and we’re starting this party from dusk

Ok … let’s go

Eminem
Back wit Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you’ll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the fumunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
Its a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed.
Bitch3s lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us. Its ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the sh-t
gets worse then worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
Its elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say we're the center of attention its true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here’s the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio’s back on you hoes.

 : Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don’t act like a snobby model.
You just hit the lotto.
Uh-oh Uh-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I notice there’s so many of them
and there’s really not that many of us.
And ladies love us, my posses kicking up dust.
Its on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

Dr Dre
They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain’t got to tell me why you’re sick cuz I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.
I’m an itch that they cant scratch, they sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cuz over and above all, its just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I’ll be dammed, just f*cked around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end
Lets cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know.
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision.
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

 : Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

The money ain’t a thang when you party with me

We ball out of control like you wouldn’t believe
I’m the napalm the bomb the don i’m King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I’m so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the shaun dawn burn marajauan do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man i’m caking you know i don’t give a f*ck
I spend it like it don’t mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherf*cker i’m grown
I stunt i style i flash the sh-t
I gets what the f*ck i want so what I trick
Fat ass burgundy bags classy sh-t Jimmy Cho shoes
I say move a bitch move

{verse 1}
all niqht i've, been starin'
can you tell i want you ?
can't be too, wide open
but there's nothin, i won't do
ohhh... just want  you to know

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

{verse 2}
I wish i... wasn't famous
I wish i... was still in school
So that i can have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you crazy

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious


{fadey fade away.... lls .}

Cause sometimes you feel tired, Feel weak
And when you feel weak
You feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
You gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that sh*t out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And be a quitter
No matter how bad you just wanna fall flat on your face

Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps as long as you feel 'em
To the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
Your coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a f*ck.


Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this sh*t till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out
I'ma rip this sh*t till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when your real
and you spit and people are feeling your sh*t.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much sh*t as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end.
Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this sh*t that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outcast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the sh*t does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people got a f*cking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you’ve got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.



Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
what is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And its absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.



Until the roof
The roof comes off
Until my legs
give out from underneath me

I will not fall,
I will stand tall,
Feels like no one could beat me.


Yesterday when we were getting high
you were invited, you woulda liked it
uh uh ah, I know you all too well
we said that we can kiss the past goodbye
but your weren't excited
there's no way to fight it
you can stay shawty but here I go


Should I spend the weekend in Vegas
I'm busy living the moment not taking pictures to save it
I mean how could I forget
my memories never faded I can't relate to these haters
my enemies never made it
I am... still here with who I started with
the game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr sh-t
carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship
yeah, I'm 23 with a money tree
growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist and thats how she met my pops
and now my garden is enormous, it's happening penny lane
I said its happening Penny Lane
just like you said I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead
uh ahh, thats word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough!


What am I afraid of
this is what dreams are supposed to made of
the people I don't have time to hang with
always look at me and say the same sh-t

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh



Am I wrong for making light of my situation
clap on when 40 got something for me to snap on
NOw that I'm on I dont want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on
get my f-cking buffett on
I heard they jsut moved my grandmother to a nursing home
and I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
but hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
that I barely know at all and
plus this women that I mess with unprotected txt us saying she wish she woulda kept it
the one I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
I couldn't tell you where the f-ck head is
I'm holding on by a thread its like I'm high right now
the guy right now and you can tell by looking at my eyes right now
that nothing really comes as a surprise right now
cause we having the time of our lives right now




I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
the other day Lissa told me she missed the old me
which made me question when I went missing
and when I start treating my friends different
maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the 2 guns in my face during the stick up
maybe cause I girl I f-cking trusted set the whole sh-t up
but a fact I have'nt seen 'em since they locked big Rich up
I know, the same time, I'm quick to forget
bout to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets
burn it al burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
cause half the itme I got it right I probably guessed
did I just trade free time for camera time
will I blow all of this money baby, hammertime
yeah, I just need some closure, aint no turning back for me
I'm in it till it's over



It's Young Money Baby
I got something for these niggas to ride to
Fa'sho
Here I go


Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now,
Su-woop to the bangers,
Su-woop to the bangers, (yeah)

Check out what I done, and
Check out who I be with
I'm me bitch, I said I'm me bitch

Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG




Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love,
Cause I don't have the time for that
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where it's at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract

I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggaz for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch

And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it

Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'

Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

 Hailie
 What??
 Come here baby
Bring daddy his Oscar
 Okay
 We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass



I'm about to get rid of some hoes it's simple
I put the Murder Inc with lead and I'm not talking about a pencil
Look at what the fuck you dun got into
I see you found your nitch you're just a bitch with a menstral
Claiming you a murderer and spelt it wrong
You put the "E" before the "D" because that's all you on
You on Pac's dick (bitch) you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins 3 deals that another nigga got you they didn't see
skills
And I ain't playing your a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be praying on his cover cause he need it
And you niggas hating shut your mouths
It's just the real niggas ain't buying that shit you put out


Doe Rae Me but we don't sing motherfuckers
So Murder Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team who expects nothing less then R 'n' B coming from that regime
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream
Now that you embrace the green don't fuck with the triple beams
You're a motherfucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen?
Artists with repituares saw him in action, Pac's assassination
Def jam grabbed him, told him reenact him you'll go platinum
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins
Reenacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in Detroit motherfucker


Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da
Don't play me cause your washed up, lost your spot
Mama say mama sa Macosaca
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
Doe Rae Me cause we're hot and you're not
Going at me is the only shot you got
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
You can get popped after all that shit you talk


Now we can skip past the mean mugs, get to the slugs
To grievance and the crying and intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga you shook,
You're half of a half-way crook nigga get off X dick go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one and when your gone you'll only be the late fake
one
Nigga please stick the script before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch, fucking old ass ignorant innocent looking senior citizen
Built up slap you like renaissance sicitive wait a minute hold on
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch made man now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holla and curse and go ahead and respond
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse


Slim set an impulse to get at the wanktas
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the drama for stucky and bush stones
What's wrong? didn't think were strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
This real witness you all ain't caught the concept
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source
Threatening at the boss you're gonna see me on your porch
Now I've got the nerve to try serve on us
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust


Do I gotta get my nigga bugs, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Caddillac, Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat
You not Pac's songs without laws will help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your "mock"avelli get your own identity


Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da
(Don't EVER say my little girls name in a song again)
Don't play me cause you're washed up, lost your spot
Mama say mama sa Macosaca
(Fucking punk pussy, BITCH!)
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
Doe Rae Me cause we're hot and you're not
(I'm gonna fuck you up boy)
Going at me is the only shot you got
(Never again in your mother fucking life)
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
(Gonna shoot the shit outta you little fucking midgets,
Hailie will whip your mother fucking asses)
You can get popped after all that shit you talk


Yeah, that's right motherfuckers
Shady Records, what you know about?
Fuck Benzino, fuck Ja Rule
Nigga, this is Obie Trice right here talking to you mother fuckers
Ja Rule punk ass yeah
Fuck his soul for real ass
Nigga that's soul, that's the nigga from 'soul for real'
Candy rain ass nigga you got a deal now you rapping
You don't know us, fagot ass mother fuckers
Give money to all my real niggas
Obie Trice, D12, G-Unit, 50 Cent, Hailie Jade Hahahaha

 Daddy is Ja Rule taller than me?

 No honey you guys are the same size

I want you to understand something
that when I come up in this b-tch I want the fans jumping,
I want the fist pumping in the air,
I dont look like a millionnaire,
but I feel like a million bucks,
ladies wont ya fill your cups,
Shadys come to fill ya up,
if your a D or a C cup
you can even be a B
its just me and DRE
youll be in the ER well be strapped with so much TNT,
we may blow no not even CPR from the EMT
could help you to resuscitate
you busters must be flustered wait
you cant cut the mustard, whats your problem cant you bust a grape,
whats my name, shady came and just crushed the game,
its really not even fair to them,
cos they pale in comparisons
so much they might aswell wear a skin,
dont you just wish you could share his pen
cos this sh-ts getting embarrassing,
the fog is stinking the air is thin,
cos he wont even let them try to breathe,
da da di di da di dee, he makes it look so easy,
girl you just hit the lottery,


now this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on,
and hell breaks loose,
try to restrain us you cant contain us,
we still gonna make a statement no matter what we do,
everywhere we go it seems were looking for any excuse to just cut loose,
so this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose,


This is when sh-ts hits the fan,
like it just splattered on stan
this is the only moment that matters,
ya homie rolled in with Mathers,
like chaos erupts Ems in back Dres in the front
so do what we say at once this songs like a singer it hunts (?),


It makes em stay in a trance
no choice they have to dance,


Its like the play-off just making sure that we stay in the hunt
take a day off of what man you better lay off the blunts
you must be smoking something
you think I aint smoking nothing stay off my nuts,
now hit the floor baby time to wipe away all the rust,
shake all them cobwebs loose,
loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose,
yeah girl shake that caboose
I dont wanna see you try to make no excuse,
DRE is on the loose,
A Mongoose when its comes to the chronic use,
you know I cant stand to lose,
me and my goons are like animals,
we come through like a pack of wolves,
so we came here to retract the roof,
yeah man aint that the truth,
girl your mans like in the booth
definitely back up in this b-tch,
this is when all hell breaks loose,




Now I know your feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words,
A murderer in the flow, liquid courage im finna blow
as soon as we hit the door power surges head to toe
Im sure to push it as far as words are meant to go,
were in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows,
ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block widcha hoe,
with speakers knocking its 3 0 clock
me and Doc then proceed to drop (?)
and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door,


Yeah so let us in fore we huff and puff and we blow,
we aint bluffin for nothing
well knock the stuffing out ya
revenge is so sweet, move til ya injure ya feet
yeah move or lose it three,
move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably,
pass some of that (?) lil right there,
that would be pretty stupid to me,
born and raised in the CPT,
yeah Los Angeles whos in the streets,
them haters hating on me,
but I refuse to lose any sleep,
keep that deuce deuce in the seat,
Dre fall off thats news to me,





Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great then I falls, my insides crawl
and I clam up (wham) I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road


I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road


I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, and the same pants
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road




You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't the skillest
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each on of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road



Yeah!

Cinderella Man (x4)

Who can catch lighting in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin out the nozzle on a fire hose, cry it and swallow

Cinderella Man (x4)

Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, takes his hands and cup em
Spin around to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff em

Cinderella Man (x4)


There's a storm comin that the weatherman couldn't predict
I've start to ball prick you better flea cuz I get ticked
it's a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch ya to the ground ya trick
It's a trap, fuck my last CD that shit's in my trash
I'll be God damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in a blink of an eye, so betcha I'll last
So keep winkin and blowin kisses cuz ur flirtin with death
I'm destroyin ur livelihood, I ain't just hurtin ur rep
I catch a flow and get goin,
No remorse, I'm showin they slowin, for no one, knowin there is nothing you can do about it
Zeroin in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I'll shut your lane down, if you can spot the parked in at 2
Arsenic flower, lighter fluid, saliva, what can you do
lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com
Go get ur crew, hype you up, stand behind you like "woooooooo"
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how bout you?
Now guess who....(Hey)
Here's a clue....(Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
Now, what's his name

Cinderella Man (x4)


If I had a time machine
I'd be...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Music is my time machine
So call me...

Cinderella Man (x4)


Fuck catchin lighting, he struck it
Screamed shut up at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward

Cinderella Man (x4)

Rewound the future to the present
Paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker he's the shit right now
he's...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Cinderella man sent to fell Shady dey
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell from hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with this Cinderella story,
nor did he come to do the same, or can't afford to be a lamo in this day and age
And at this stage in the game, mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old H-I to the new Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah
The coupe de gras, raise em high, in the sky
People are tryin to bring this place alive
Thanks for bein patient I will make no more mistakes,
shit my Potatoes baked homie the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin weed, yea faggot the stakes are high
Shit I ain't even supposed to be here by the grace of God
By the skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts I skated by
Now ya'll are on in ice with ankle weights I hate to lie
Now how fuckin irritated are you, how much in ur face am I
And there ain't shit you can do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and I'm a spittin image I mirror it
When I stand near it, ur pussy lyric I couldn't hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
Who? (Hey)
Here's a clue (Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater and lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
now...what's his name




I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous a**
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your a**
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that s*** you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.)
Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Drawin' a Blank like
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.

Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma do that for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()

Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
Imeet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

()

This is why I do this shit.

I think they call this, uhm, venting.

 1:

Look
Uhh.

This is me.
Still the same.
They want the hits.
I play the game.
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.
It all comes spilling out like i hit a vein.
Watt up lil Braw.
Watt up slum Ville.
I hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still.
The fans thinking that we all signed for one meal.
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.
That aint how it works.
That aint that how it goes.
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.
And I could use a writer to balance out my flows.
But I never share my thoughts,
This is all a nigga knows.
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised.
And I would be performing just as long as Im alive.
So every word I utter will be mine.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
Oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

 2:
I never cried when Pac died.
But I probably will when Hov does.
And if my tears hold value, then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us.
And Ill be standing in a puddle.
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.
And ima keep it honest.
Am so tired of being subtle.
Its just me, Forty, O, and nich standing in a huddle.
Staring at the members of my team.
Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme.
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.
I hope you tell your family this shit aint what it seems.
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.
And know I pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions.
At least I put it all in the open.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

 3:
Look.
Fuck all yall.
We ignore feelin's here.
Premature millionaires.
Welcome to my realest year.
Yeah.
I swear we making a killah here.
I should be on top of the world here just chillen here.
Uh.
But its funny having fans.
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance, and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit dont feel the same.
Yeah.
And plus things are just so real at home
People think Ive changed just because my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere so im never actually am alone, i just always feel alone.
I think im scared of what the future holds.
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.
Every girl I meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes.
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
All my old friends think i got a new crowd.
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.
I guess that mean they come few and far between.
Even though am living out what you would call adream.
Yeah.
And my uncle aint even messaging me.
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.
I hope this isnt one of those forever things.
Its funny how money can change everything.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.


I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25 sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?


One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt?
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

 

Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your motherfucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?, cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6

 1:
Aiyyo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, cause they be actin maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming pills or roaches, we sprayed and disinfects
and twist the necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass in a track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
I'm Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

 2:
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, some fruit to stomp,and then two feet to rinse
I greet intensive ladies, I spoil all your fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the only one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My a capella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

 3:
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility 
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tractical, tactful, track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
I'm Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite(x2)

Drake-Over-Thank me later

Makin sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin
Bout to set it off, set it off in this Bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldnt've drove, tell me how Im gettin home?
You too fine to be layin down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I needs a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the swishers
I did it overnight, it couldnt happen any quicker
Yall know them? Well, fuck it, me either
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make'em a believer
It wouldnt be the first time I done it, throwin hundreds
When I should be throwin ones, bitch, I run it (Ah)

:

2
One thing bout music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, its just game
Its just what comes with the fame, and Im ready for that, Im just sayin
But I really cant complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinking Ima quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
Im really too young to be feelin this old
Its about time you admit it, who you kiddin, man?
Man, nobodys never done it like I did it (Ugh)

I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last year, who the fuck are yall?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just cant remember it all

What am I doing? What am I doing?

You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you're the f-cking coldest
Intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

Well aren't you a breath of fresh air
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they aint got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking somes d-cks until some millions appear
Voila! you do it right he might just buy you a car
Unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre
Independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer
Make it rain finger (check)
M3 beamer (check)
Champagne range
Triple white Caddy
Closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and BeBe
Ya don't need it greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who f-ck for bowls of baked ziti

Wave em at the b-tches hating on you with their friends

Devil in a tight dress
Girl you a killer and aint nobody realer
And aint nobody realer, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Showtime
Go, go, go, go, go, go
As we proceed.


Uh, 5 and a half in boys
Ass is off the hook
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never
But never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever
You just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas
And enough money to loan us a little something extra
Should we ever need it
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it

I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost


I’ve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn’t change
And I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? please don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours we both know
We know, they don’t get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste,ah
Pushing me away so I give her space,ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
I’ll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don’t know
Trying to run from that, say you’re done with that
On your face girl, it just don’t show
When you’re ready, just say you’re ready
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
And the party's over, just don’t forget me
We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won’t ever have to worry,
You won’t ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes


Cause if you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost


Yeah
It’s my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can’t deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don’t say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you’re following your heart
Cause your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know, you hate being alone
You ain’t the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin’ to save you
Instead they say,
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true


I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost 

I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous a**
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your a**
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that s*** you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same

Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that noila got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?

Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been?
You deserve rounds tonight, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight

Intro]
 I wanna hit line drives...
 Wanna lose weight and keep eating...
 For you...
 Hey, whats up doc?


 Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
 You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
 To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth
 I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
 The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
 Looked in the mirror, then realized I-I-I had something to prove
 You told me "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
 Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the road


 And I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), and I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
 And I run it, (Yeah! Blow!), and I run it, (Yeah! Blow!)
 That's ironic, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
 That's ironic, (Y-Yeah! Blow!), I run it, (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)
 Salt all in my wounds
 Hear my tears all in my tunes
 Let my life loose in this booth
 Just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused
 And I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), and I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
 And I run it, (Y-Yeah! Blow!), and I run it (Yeah! Blow!) That's ironic

 This shit make a nigga just wanna write
 Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
 Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
 Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
 I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
 Tell a story that I'll never glory 25
 Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
 And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
 Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
 Nobody gon' abide by your rule
 Nobody holding your gun, how come your tongue say killa then kill my mood
 Light speed living in the world you know
 Little old me, feeling like a live wire
 Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
 Til' I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
 I am from the bottom of the jungle
 Living in the bottom of the food chain
 When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
 A new name, want stripes, and you and zebra look alike
 Hope another homicide don't numb you and none do
 Things we will never learn soon
 In the era where we wanna earn soon
 That's a error, you can smell it in the air and everybody really doomed
 That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
 All y'all can suck my dick
 All them days at the county building
 Now I'm 'bout to make my mama rich
 Cartoons and (cereal!) I ain't felt this good since
 Scrooge McDuck, (here we go!) Elementary hood shit




 This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
 Even with a pot to piss in
 I'mma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
 Dismiss any business of yours
 Discounts never did amount to a check
 That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
 Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
 AKs for the whole hood
 House lick went down perfect
 Two shots to the head he deserved it
 I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
 Dark Wing Duck lost service
 Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
 Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
 I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
 This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
 Emerging on everbody corner (dash for it)
 Get a toe tag when you play tag with a task of a new (task force)
 Everybody wanna know my life
 How did I make it (past yours)
 Well let me tell you like this
 I've been running this shit since (I asked for it)
 Cartoons and cereal




 Salt all in my wounds
 Hear my tears all in my tunes
 Let my life loose in this booth just for you
 Mufucka hope y'all amused!
 I did wrong, karma came
 Crackers gave me ball and chain
 Friends, enemies all the same
 State, fed, both can hang
 Nobody can mute me, but I never said nobody can't shoot me
 Just another stat to the white folks
 Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
 Everyday feel like the one before
 Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
 If you do what you always done
 Then you get what you always got
 You dumb buffoons!
 I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
 For about the past 72 hours
 Hand on my heart, face to the hood
 I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
 Yeah this me, no mic
 No cameras, no lights, just pain
 Mama how much trauma can I sustain?
 Dirty money come with lots of stains
 Road to riches come with lots of lanes
 Just another player with lots of game
 Never had shit, got lots to gain...

Just another player with lots of game
 Never had shit, got lots to gain

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic
I like to ask it, don't ask for
Your favorite rapper

(He dead) yessir
(Amen) chuuch
(He dead) I killed him
(Amen) bitch

And this is rigamortis
And it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus
The Matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit
You an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme
If you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin
And then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph
Into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures
My listeners reply and tell me
That you biting style
You got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while
Just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight
We always making them duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI, just might investigate
This fucking parasite

(He dead)
(Amen)

That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity
This is studio felony
There would not be so many
And cool enough for the 70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch
And bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant
Rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody
Couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q
It's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
So the system ain't why we ___
Ain't nothing else you can do

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I killed him
(He dead) hahaha
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask who your favorite rapper

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask who your favorite rapper

I rapped him and made him Casper
I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya
I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, once you sinister
Bible study faster
You hypocrite is reaction of blasphemy
I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done
And tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds
Don't talk to be bout no money
The sun is under my feet
And I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap
My statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek
And I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody done see
Some persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the streets
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick, in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
And y'all fucks, never could hassle me
And y'all luck, just ran out you'll see

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen

I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

You understand me?
Showtime, headlines
Big time, sunshine, tote nines
Bust mines, flatline, hard grind
High life, stay fly as jet time
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga
Stunt nigga
I might just bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe

Look inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt and never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don’t know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


I’m trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I’m looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I’ll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


You ain’t heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don’t you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3′s in the air I can see you are – in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I’ll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it’s alive
My new year’s resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say – Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe



I was born with a dick in my brain
Yea fucked in the head
My step-father said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
"Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?"
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said, 
"I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid"
The bastard won't even eat nothing he scared
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead
Debby don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there stick a fucking cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's faking it
I bet you, I'll bet he prolly wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course unless you object
Ah, go fuck his brains out if any is left in his head



If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane



You get it? No I just tried to bite my face off
I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw bit the fucking blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop
Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like king kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he layed all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants he took every fucking thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yea, maniac that Shady dog
Man that motherfuckers gangsta, ain't he dog?
Shady dog, what be going through that fucking brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waiting for? Sing along.




Don't you know what felch means? (Yea)
Well then tell me, would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp belch and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying man? can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my step-father felt me
Fuck a little puppet kick the puppy while he's yelping
Shady what the fuck you saying? I don't know help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fucking melting!
Marshall I just love you boy I care about your well-being
No dad I said no, I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy I can do it by myself see
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it Pubic Hair on Chelsey
Well this is called Ass-Rape and we're shooting the Jail scene






I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I...
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real 


I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself




I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they mow that's green
I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you love me
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and their present is old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?




The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word "but", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real


"... I ain't trippin' off that Dominos anymore, just calling, sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did homie". "Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga". "Realness is responsibility, realness is taking care of your motherfucking family, realness is god, nigga"




"Alright that's all I wanted to tell you, just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom."

"Boy you better have my jawn on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't tripping. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by the food for less, and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take this music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago you know that's what we do."


Sing my song, it's all for you 


"If I don't hear from you, by tomorrow... I hope you come back, and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back, with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? talk to you later, bye."




Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?


Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There is vomit on his sweater already
Moms spaggehti he's nervous
But on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over BLOW!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that
But he's broke, he's so sad that he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home
That's when it's back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody, better go capture this moment
And hope it don't collapse on him


You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better


Soul's escapin' through this hole's that is gaping
This world is mines for the taking
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring
But superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads got him
He knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold ya nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold prada
They moved on to the next shmo who flows
Who nose dove and sold nada
And so the so proper
His toll, it unfolds and I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on
Duh duh doe, duh doe, dah dah dah dah




No more games, I'ma change for due called rage
Tear this muthafuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped writin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Pfifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's gettin' even harder tryin' to feed and water
My seed plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a pre-madonna
Baby momma drama, screamin' on her
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotony 
Has gotten me to the point
I'm like a snail, I've got to formulate a plot
Or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only muthafuckin' option, failure's not
Momma love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot
Feet fail me not
Cause maybe the only opportunity that I got




Duh doo
You can do anything you set your mind to, man




We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!


Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here


Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth
Cuz the people that hurt can’t understand it
You speakin outlandish, I’m ashamed how to make it all work
Another planet, it’s a short term role for me
I rec it’s all for me, it’s just mo with me
And you’re here for you too here can re-persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin off, I ain’t takin off these pistons
I’m takin off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much it’d cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a shortterm goal, no sky is the limit
I’m past that, now pass that
A word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours


I see myself performing at
Soldout shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammys, winning 5 awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Can’t imagine how it feels
That’s why I’m smiling every day
Cause my dream ain’t far away


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


You’re looking at me and tell me I’m blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I’m at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, I’m reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I’m a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow I’mma take that I’ll never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I root
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin to you, I was walkin it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello


And I’m so happy I cry
Cause I can’t believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it’s so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you play so hard
And you’ve come so far
And you go, that is the time for you to leave your more
And I’m gonna do it
Watch me


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better 

Just the two of us.. 


Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Just the two of us..

Intro:
Where's my snare
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you eva been hated, or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin', and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigga me, but they'll neva figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probley sick of me now
Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ha!

I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Imma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a coupla months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side,
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work
Wit her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I grew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't't't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, MA!
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, MA!
But guess what, ya gettin' olda now and it's cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your FUNERAL
See whets hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yaself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get,
You selfish bitch
I hope you fuckin' burn in in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Let's get it, I can't wait to trick man
It's gonna be so sweet
Summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine

Still like, "Can you hit it with your OVO goose on?"
I'm like, "What are you on?"
Told me that she two on, ha, that's cute we a few on
I could show you what to do in this bitch
Take the addy with the water pop two and then sip
Me, you and your bitch
And we talkin' bout life, love too and this dick
First I had her in the six, then we had her in the six
You know I got another bar for ya
I'mma chill baby, we don't want the devil in this bitch, nah
Got a bad one we could call it Kelly Rowland
Oh she get the jelly rollin', Akinyele in the telly
Cause she open I could tell that she from Oakland
Pasadena, what up?

I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2

A nigga got a woosah, comin' at me never work no matter who try
I got 'em all a cheque without the woo-hah
Flip modes on ya quick got a few sides
Comin' from the 6 side
Where niggas goin' shower posse just to get by
Stay true never switch sides, yea, the game turn me into this guy
Yea, and now every time Drake out
Cameras always flashing tryna put me on the Takeout
Crib in Calabasas man I call that shit the safe house
Thirty minutes from L.A. the shit is way out
But these days that's where I'm stayin'
You can hear it in my voice I'm goin' way in
Yea, OB that my brother like a Wayans
Just know I only show up if you payin', nigga
Yea, I always been on, I always been too on
For like the past five years all these niggas wanna shine
I got the flashlight here man
Bout to hit the gas right here man
Old soul livin' in the past life here man
You, bring the cash right here man
Miracle, sit your ass right here man
Man, You know I hate to wait
That's why I get it first and you get it late
Yea, OVO sound that man that's everyday
It's Young Money Records get the record straight

I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2 on
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2

You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so bad girl, you're so awful
I fuck you right in my office
You go tell your friends you're honest
That's why all your friends are on
You know you made me a promise
We're not in this for commitment
Your man's gone and you don't miss him
Book you flights and confirmation
Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasing that paper
Even though you're exhausted you're still gonna make it girl
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so, you're so
You love to get 2 on

And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know that I put you on
And you know, that's something yo

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
Last name ever 
First name greatest 
Like a sprained ankle boy ainâ€™t nothing to play with 
It started off local but thanks to all the haters 
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis 
And your city faded off to brown, Nino 
She insists she got more class, we know 
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo 
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo 
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album 
Whoâ€™d have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome 
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm 
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one 
Yeah nigga Iâ€™m about my business 
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list 
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness 
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness 
Bitches 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
I used to have hood dreams 
Big fame, big chains 
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came 
I went hard all fall like the ball teams 
Just so I can make it rain all spring 
Yâ€™all seen my story my glory 
I had raped the game young 
You can call it statutory 
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me 
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin 
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin 
You would think I ran the world like Michelleâ€™s husband 
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnâ€™t 
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnâ€™t 
Youâ€™re such a fucking loser 
He didnâ€™t even go to class Bueller 
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back 
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack 
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac 
All the way in Hollywood and I canâ€™t even act 
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap 
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
Ok, hello it's da Martian 
Space jam Jordanâ€™s 
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden 
Fresher than the harvest 
Step up to the target 
If I had one guess than I guess Iâ€™m just New Orleans 
And I will never stop like Iâ€™m running from the cops 
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top 
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops 
But what should I scream for this is my theme park 
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark 
Pistol on my side you donâ€™t wanna hear that thing talk 
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention 
Lil Wayne thatâ€™s what they got to say or mention 
Iâ€™m like Nevada in the middle of the summer 
Iâ€™m resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover 
Shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas 
No brake pads, no such thing as last 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
There they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow 
Nuts they go, macadamia they go so ballistic, whoa 
We can make them look like Bosoâ€™s 
Heâ€™s wondering if he should spit this slow 
Fuck no! Go for broke 
His cup just runneth over, oh no 
He ainâ€™t had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed 
Theyâ€™ve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose 
Back into the game and they know 
Rap will never be the same as before 
Bashing in the brains of these hoes 
And establishing a name as he goes 
The passion and the flame is ignited 
You canâ€™t put it out once we light it 
This shit is exactly what the fuck that Iâ€™m talking about when we riot 
You dealinâ€™ with a few true villains 
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillinâ€™ 
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths 
Now rewind it! 
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me, so howâ€™s it taste? 
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place 
Iâ€™m Hannibal Lecter so just in case youâ€™re thinking of saving face 
You ainâ€™t gonna have no face to save by the time Iâ€™m through with this place 
So Drakeâ€¦ 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man

byy: chelsey baybayy!!

That's what they doin', Cameron, they actin' like these singers, man.
I ain't goin' to the studio until I got a situation.
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer.
Who gonna be on the hook?
Man, what is you doin'?
Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!

Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though
Voice mail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, "nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, "the first mill gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work

Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)

Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man

Hear What?
Yo hear what, tek time
(Laughing)
Ahh, no shit!
Yo hear what?
Wa gwan ...
Yo him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van you know Drizzy

Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing

I do better with the rider in my system
Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called "Hi! My Name Is" dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I've went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain, the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to…

I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

I know what it's like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in that trailer park?
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than make another motherfucking "We Made You", uh
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania,
So when they empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was... gone

I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way o-o-out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear

YEAHH !!!

Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker. Boys playin' Playstation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?

Yeah, sound sound sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this?
How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions
We ain't doing no interview

Yeah, yeah, oh, you gotta love it
Oh, you got, oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried
It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual, my career's like a "how to "manual
So I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we have words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to R.I.P. about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But man, oh, you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it


Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn’t everything
I’m having a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that i'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time 
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well never mind,
I I I tried to told you, drizzy still ain’t nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cars saying fuck ya life
Okay now we outta here
Toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up
I got the voodoo for you bitches
I’m busy getting rich, I don’t want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double
Famous like a drug that I've taken too much
I never ever trip
Just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does


I'm about whatever man..
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it

Whole crews in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team. Man I love my team..
I would die for these niggas..


Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her Imma get her
I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mix tape?
That was just a keepsake
Bought the president the Louie presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks I ain’t talking about the peach state
Man for Petes sake scratch that, sweep stakes
(hahahaha)
Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you like no
I’m a bad bitch I ain’t never been a mixed breed.
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed
M M M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
But I collect 100 thou at the venue
And pop bottles with my team young money til the death of me


I'm about whatever man..
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it

I've been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? It can't be
They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
I promise to always give you me, the real me


Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go


Owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright life'd make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumbs could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do


Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Wait until the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again
Soon as you get in

Drake]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got sh*t on what you're feeling now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man
Yeah I said it, B*tch I'm the man
Don't you forget it

The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in the speaker right now: that's me
And the voice in the mirror, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted, with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason that you always getting faded

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me

Ok look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things

It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of "Mr Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me


May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you
And heaven accept you..

CHORUS (1x):


END!!!


Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you


I'm just so fucking depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump,
but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up, 
in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided to just pick this pen
Up to try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, 
I need a new outlet
And I know some shits so hard to swallow, 
but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you got to walk a thousand miles


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humour
Everything's so tense and gloom, I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room
Just as soon as I walk in, It's like all eyes on me, 
so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that it then it opens the door for conversation, 
like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, 
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, 
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack, and half of them ain't even funny,
like "AAHHHHH!
Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn!"
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell, hell
We don't gotta trade our shoes, and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves, and flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could of either just sat on my ass, and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in, and get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never 
did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me, keep making that face til it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there holding my tounge, 
tryna talk like BLEGH!
Then I stuck my tounge on that frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson then, 
'cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story, not just based off my description
Cause where you see it form where you're sitting, 
is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a miles in eachothers shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you

Yeah, to my babies, stay strong, dad will be home soon
And to the rest of the world... God gave you them shoes, to fit you
So put them on and wear them... be yourself man, 
be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny... 
don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful



I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly,
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home (home)

I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly,
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it (oh yeah)
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

So just hold on we're going home (going home)
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on we're going home (going home, going home)

You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Oh just hold on we're going home (going home)
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on we're going home (going home, going home)
Hold on 

Complexion (two-step) 
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love) 
Complexion (two-step) 
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love) 

Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun 
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done 
Sneak (dissin’) 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga 
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you 
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down 
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention 

Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' Sun 
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run 
Sneak (dissin') 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga 
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you 
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down 
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention 
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival 
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival 
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken 
By different shades of faces 
Then wit told me, "You're womanless, woman love the creation" 
It all came from God then you was my confirmation 
I came to where you reside 
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes 
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with... 

You like it, I love it 
You like it, I love it 

Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2pac 
Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die 
Color of your skin, color of your eyes 
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby 
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey 
All my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave 
12 years of age, thinkin’ my shade too dark 
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid 
And forcin’ my dark side like a young George Lucas 
Light don’t mean you smart, bein’ dark don’t make you stupid 
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin’ “Woohah!” 
Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored 
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times 
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion 
It ain’t complex to put it in context 
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context 
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest 
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed 
Ain’t no stress, jigga boos wanna be 
I ain’t talkin’ Jay, I ain’t talkin’ Bey 
I’m talkin’ days we got school watchin’ movie screens 
And spike yourself esteem 
The new James Bond gon’ be black as me 
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea 
And it’s all beautiful to me 
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens 
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing 

Barefoot babies with no cares 
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car? 
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse 
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth


Cause some things just don’t change
It’s better when they stay the same
Althought the whole world knows your name
So on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game
Ooooohhhhhhh
It shouldn’t be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice you remain
fuck em’ all, tell ‘em all eat shit, here we go again

So, god damn… is it that time again already
Haha, you don’t look too happy to see me
fuck man, don’t everybody welcome me back at once
All right, fuck ya’ll then


You can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, I’m nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, Dog fall back you mutts
fuck your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy
fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck sick mummy
And my nuts licked, gobble ‘em up trick, yummy
 b**ch you don’t fucking think that I know that you suck dick dummy?
You’ll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it’s funny!
Shawty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don’t listen to ‘em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker
Motherfucker might aswell let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, cause I’m just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on, cause you wen’t and pissed me off
Now I’m sitting and pissing on everbody
give a fuck if it’s right or wrong
So buck the buddah, light a bong
But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, cmon


Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh


fuck it I’m a loose cannon, Bruce Banner’s back in the booth
Ya’ll are sitting ducks, I’m the only goose standing
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my d*ck in a circle, but I’m not fucking around motherfucker
I’ll show you pussy footin, I’ll kick a bitch in the cunt
Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin’, you musta mistook me for some sissy
Soft punk looking for some nookie or boosom
Go ahead, fucking hater push me
I told you ain’t no fucking way to shush me
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G’s up
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!)
Man chill, nah I can’t god damnit
Rap is a land fill, drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can’t fill
shit the day that happens the world’ll stop spinning
And Michael J. Fox’ll come to a stand still
During an earthquake, urine in your face
Cause you’re fake, ahh what the fuck, that hurt wait!
Ahh what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening
Alright then I quit, god I give up
Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To hell I’ll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh


How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day
til I hang up the mic and it’s time for me to say
So long, til then i drop the fucking bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long
If you don’t like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh b**ches don’t like that, homie I’ll be nicer to women
When aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming
lyrics courtesy of killer hip hop dot com
Man I’m a cold soul, I roll solo so
So don’t compare me to them other bums over there
It’s like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
I’m bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I’ll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

(Outro)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I don’t know, I don’t know what caused, I don’t know what caused me to be this wayme to be this way
I don’t know, I don’t know by I probably be this way til my dying day
I don’t know why I’m so, I’m so cold beat bangs, I don’t need to say
I guess this is how you made me



Uh
I’m just so far gone
October’s own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screaming in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on
Where did we go wrong
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game
And its one I can’t post pone
Meaning if it rains
I’m the one its raining on
With my diamond chain’s on
Still nothing setting stone
Women borrow sweaters
That I spray with my cologne
And tell me don’t forget them
And I promise that I won’t
Feeling so distant from everyone I’ve known
To make everybody happy
I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown
Parties that we’ve thrown
I done more for this city
Than these rappers that have blown
Its only been 3 years
Look at how I’ve grown
I’m just in my zone
I call this shit the calm

Yeah

But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom
And I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay
And it wont even take that long
You can see it in my face
Even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school
Its proven and its known
I’m sittin’ in a chair
But in the future, it’s a throne
I know you like to worry
It’d be better if you don’t
Cuz….


You know…
Everything gone be all right
I promise
I apologize to you know
Put y’all in this position
40 Mama always say
Don’t ask permission, just ask forgiveness you know
So uhh
Forgive me
Yeah


Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a vantage you can gain
They love it when you smile
Unaware that it’s a strain
It’s a curse you gotta live with
When you’re born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say you’re the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Terrence in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It’s a weight that’s on my chest
Who ever spottin’ me is playin’
So I’m liftin’ all alone
Trynin’ not to get a sprain
Hopin’ Western Junior doin’ currency exchange

Cuz my dad called
It got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like
I had a rolls and I went and got a range
And he payin’ for his cigarettes
With some dollars and some change
Yeah
And I can only feel his pain
Cuz in Memphis, Tennessee
There is only so much to attain
So I’m fillin’ out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me
I just hope he doesn’t say that shit in vain
I’m why your girls heart is in a slain
Call me Heartbreak Drake
I’m the hardest one to tame
As a man, I’m just honest
As an artist, I’m a king
With my own set of problems
That be sittin’ on my brain
Yeah
And see this is the thang
What they viewin’ as braggin’
Is the way that I maintain
The shit I write
While starin’ out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I remain

Me


Yeah…
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
That’s why I’m putting on
They always wanna ask what type of act that you putting on
Like…. Damn 


Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn’t be driving, it just got so much harder
Can’t even see straight, I can’t even see straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I’m the truth that’s right I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain’t gotta die to get to heaven
You Girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How’d I know, how’d I know? That’s me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you asking me my where-abouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rappin’ bitches, rappin’ bitches bitches
And rappin’ rappin’ an’ bitches until all of us switches
I swear, it’s been two years since somebody ask me who I was
I’m the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
That’s whats important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing “walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I’m a uptown nigga, ah”
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways


People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)


Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon’ tell me that she don’t dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that’s all I’m really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin’ furs like its snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that’s the shit that she like
So why am I a classic, this is who I’m trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turnin’ papers in won’t get me paid
If I don’t nothing I’mma ball
I’m countin all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah I need that, making major changes to the life I’m living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways



People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)

Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do


All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting, I told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

 

Oh shit! 
Oh, I need that 
I need that sloppy 
That sloppy 
Like a Chevy in quicksand 
That sloppy 

This feelin' is unmatched 
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap 
Black (Pendleton) ball cap 
(West, west, west) 
We don't share the same synonym fall back 
(West, west, west) 
Been in it before internet had new acts 
Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack 
My innocence limited the experience lacked 
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked 
The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact 
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic 
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards 
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction 
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest 
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic 
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion 
Winnin' in every decision 
Kendrick is master and mastered it 
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction? 
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic 
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque 
But what's better than that? 
The fact it brought me back home 

We been waitin' for you 
Waitin' for you 
Waitin' for you 
Waitin' for you 

I know everything, I know myself 
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health 
I know fatality might haunt you 
I know everything, I know Compton 
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything 
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors 
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma 
I know everything, I know history 
I know the universe works mentally 
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me 
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money 
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's Ornery 
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies 
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition 
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision 
I know you know that lines from Compton School District 
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip about how it was distributed 
I know how people work, I know the price of life 
I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well 
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit 
The day I came home 


Nappy afro, gap in his smile 
Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd 
Runnin' home and the man and woman that crossed him 
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted 
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles 
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin' 
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language 
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted 
Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous 
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was takin' 
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it 
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor 
Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress 
And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil 
You spoiled by fantasies of who you are 
I feel bad for you 
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you 
If you resist, I'll back off go catch a flight or two 
But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace 
Than be an advocate go tell your homies especially 
To come back home 

This is a world premiere 
This is a world premiere 
This is a world premiere 

I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite 
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside? 
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind? 
Tell me something got me losing my mind, AH! 
You make me wanna jump 
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump 
(Let's talk about love)) 
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump 
(Let's talk about love)) 
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite 
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside? 
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind? 
Tell me something think I'm losing my mind, AH! 
I say where you at, from the front to the back 
I'm lookin' for you I react, only when you react 
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto 
When I was seventeen with the .38 special 
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real 
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel 
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway 
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway 
I can be your advocate 
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is

Hello
Yeah I just walked in
Yeah I'm good you still working?
Tonight, right now?
'Did I go out' yeah I went out
I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed
Shit... wine or water
You said something about a cold drink
I don't know, I'm delirious... night


Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy

But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
"F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing thats so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say

F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin' 'bout bitches
That we almost had
I don't think I'm concious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeh we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeh, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women thats living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on


Well I'm sorry" -- Drake
Are you drunk right now? -- Woman

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me


You're not going to come?
Guess i'm bout to just kick it here then...

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Drizzy,
Oh yeah Trey I fucking feel you,
They be staring at the money like it's unfamiliar,
I get it,
I live it,
To me there's nothings realer,
Just enough to solve your problems,
Too much would kill ya,
And when I leave,
I always come right back here,
The young spit it and everybody in rap fear,
A lot of ya'll still sounding like last year,
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier,
Nickels for my thoughts,
Dimes in my bed,
Quarters of the kush,
Ain't the limes in my head,
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD,
Yeah,
I want it all,
That's why I strive for it,
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it,
I know what's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Yeah,
I want things to go my way,
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,
And my mother tried to runaway from home,
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway,
And she cried to me so I cried too,
And my stomach was soaking wet,
She only 5'2,
And 48 hours all before I showed up,
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
Damn my reality just set in,
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
I do a lot of things,
Hoping I never have to fit in,
So trying to keep up with my programs is like a dead end,
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
And life change for us every single week,
So what's good,
But I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Wise words from a decent man,
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand,
This lost boy got fly without peter pan,
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,
In person I am everything and more,
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,
Just call me shop and bag drizzy,
And call me Mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy,
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad,
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
To big homie use a flash if you must,
And I swear I ain't asking for much
All I want is


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

It's like I know what I got to say,
I just don't know how to say it to you


Pardon the swag,
But bitches cartate,
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,
How come I can't,
Miss a woman like I can't miss cartdates,
Cheese,
But shes not in this portrait,
Life's fine but I don not portray,
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
I don't want the glow,
I want the glow ray,
And I'm a fuck the world,
But this is just foreplay,
Tired of hearing bullshit,
Bring her on to cowshit,
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than ? shit,
That's word to toronto,
So high up I got birds in the condo,
Ain't that a female dog,
Ask her who I am to her,
And she yell god,
Weezy baby go ? hard,
No further details boy.

Drake] 
I am on a 24 hour champagne diet

On records im captain hook and my new car is roofio 
Damn 
Where my roof just go 
Im somebody that you should know 
Get to shakin somethin cus thats what Drumma produced it for 
Yes i make mistakes that i dont ever make excuses for 
Like leavin' girls that love me and Constantly seducing hoes 
Im losing my thoughts i say damn 
Where my roof just go? 
Top slipped off like Janet at the super bowl,

All over your skin 
Got money to blow oh oh oh oh

We certified gettin it CM YM Cash Money business 
Higher than the ceiling fly like a bird, hit the gucci store 
And later get served 
We smoked out with no roof on it 
Them people passin so we smash on them 
Ballin out we keep the cash on deck 
Lamborghini and the Bentleys on the V-set 
Louie lens iced out with the black diamonds 
Car of the year Ferrari the new Spider 
No lie im higher than i ever been 
Born rich born uptown born to win 
Fully loaded automatic 6 Benz 
Candy paint foreign lights with my b-tch in 
Born hustlin too big n-gga to strive me up 
Cant stop me more money burn em up 

 

 
When I get paid every 24 hours money and the power 
Come to VIP and get a Champagne Shower

And Im with two women make you take a second look 
We poppin like Champagne Bottles But We Never Shook 
and We Goin Be Alright If We Put Drake On Every Hook

What's wrong nigga? 
I thought you was keeping it gangsta? 
I thought this what you wanted? 
They say if you scared go to church 
But remember 
He knows the bible too 

My baby when I get you get you get you get you 
Ima go head to ride with you 
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you 
Cause I (want you) 
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty 
Registration is out of service 
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving 
Cause I (want you) 
I want you more than you know 

I remember you took me to the mall last week baby 
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times 
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified 
That I (want you) 
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy 
I said you crazy 
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you) 

You said to me 
You said your name was Lucy 
I said where's Ricardo? 
I said oh no, not the show 
Than you spit a little rap to me like this 
When I turned 26 I was like oh shit 
You said this to me 
I remember what you said too you said 
My name is Lucy Kendrick 
You introduced me Kendrick 
Usually I don’t do this 
But I see you and me Kendrick 
Lucy Give you no worries 
Lucy got million stories 
About these rappers I came after when they was boring 
Lucy gone fill your pockets 
Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton 
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised 
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty 
Avoiding me? 
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly 
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute 
Lucy work harder 
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father 
I'm Lucy 
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly 
Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me 
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front 
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work 
I want you to know that Lucy got you 
All your life I watched you 
And now you all grown up then sign this contract if that’s possible 

I remembered you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room 
I didn't wanna self destruct 
The evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went runnin' for answers 
Until I came home




Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah.


I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far


I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
"Cleaning Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause, Ma,
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to Chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away it drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old,
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but




'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for "Cleaning Out My Closet", at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though,
'cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own,
But now the medications taken over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have,
'cause one thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths,
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest,
I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my mama...




I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girl
So I never say, "Goodbye, cruel world."
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die



I want a new life 


It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya
See ya picture, now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya


Yeah, one time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch


I'm so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need


I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Air Force stunting flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that muthafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on


I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Takin' everything slow, so slow, so slow but I do it to her


Drapped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end


Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rollin' through the city
Bumpin' that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like everything just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone

Uh,
I'm just so far gone, 
October's own, 
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong,
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown,
parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne

You know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A
Pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
You know, so... forgive me
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

Uh,
And life is so insane, 
Look what I've became, 
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why yo girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain

Me, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man.


Yeah, uh-huh


Uh, hardly home but always reppin,
You hardly on and always second,
When I'm awake you always restin,
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question,
I, I'm doin classic shit in all my sessions,
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin,
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions,
I just always did my own thing,
Now I run the game, you stupid muddasuckas
I see all this money through my ohio state buck eyes,
Shippin goin good, but good can turn to better,
Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
come on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
come on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Yeah, wrong way down the one way,
Women don't get saved round me even on a sunday,
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who,
Then they meet my pop and tell 'I'm ''Drake is just a younger you'',
And shawty wanna party so don't let yo girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ, of me givin her mouth-to-mouth,
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her,
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcom X an Martin Luther
I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady,
They just loose to love, those are tennis games lady,
Have you countin money goin dufflebag-crazy,
Sippin on Pink Floyd an puffin Wayne Brady,
Damn, who's line is it anyways,
I'm in the daze, you been amazed, y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage,
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze,
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right,
You look nice, and yo frame, makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well alright, guess I might, know what fuck it yes I will,
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin less than real
Put it to you right


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
come on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest,
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused,
The gangstas recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's,
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus,
Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this ibomb, I palm
The game like it's a spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great mike,
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this gon be a great night,
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white,
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,
This that major moment you've been waitin on for too long,
The best that ever did it an doin it on a new song,
UGK an Young Money too strong
Down in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


I am the leather jacket, black glasses, all american bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket an you, you just a bag boy
Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you neva had boy
Hate an I will leave ya chest the color of my flag boy
Super bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
An I keep that toaster you can come an be my strudel biiiitch
I'm so uptown, an mothafucker if you aint don't go uptown,

And now I'm on that rock-shit
But why they let me in I'm a start shootin at a mosh pit, haha

Best believe I understand

You can run an tell my city it's on




(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
> Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will serve you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?


(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right


(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right
Aw Yeah

(Intro) 

Yeah, can't stop now... 
This maybe the last chance I get, to be famous 

(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 1) 

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist, they call me Slim Rothelsberger 
I get beserker than a fed up post office worker 
A murker with a mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered 
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter 
For a gangsta, you should of shit your pants when you saw 
The chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel 
I faced her around when his fangs come out, get your brains blown out 
That's what I call blowing your mind, when I come back like nut on your spine 
I'm a thumbtac that you slept on son 
Now here I come screaming "attack" like I just stepped on one! 
Lowering the totem til' he showed 'em, defiance, giant scrotum 
He don't owe them bitches shit, his bridges, he out wrote 'em 
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the south pole and 
Nobody fucks with him, rigamortis and post-mortem 
He's dying of boredom, take your best rhymes, record 'em 
Then try to thwart him, he'll take your punchlines and snort 'em 
Shit stained drawers, you gon' fuck with the guy that licks the blades of his chainsaws 
While he dips 'em in P.F. chang's sauce 
Game's off homie, hang it up like some crank calls 
You think I'm backing down, you must be out your dang skulls! 
I'm almost famous 


(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 2) 

I'm back for revenge, I lost the battle, that ain't happening again 
I'm at your throat like strep, I step strapped with a pen 
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are distorting my mem-ory 
Some are wrote on a napkin, do what I have to to win 
Pulling out all stops, any who touch a mic prior 
Is not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers 
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the whacko 'for 
I take a shit in his jackolantern then smash it on his porch 
Now get off my dick, dick's too short of a word for my dick 
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism you prick! 
Don't call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer 
I just blew up the challenger, matter of fact, I need a lawyer 
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast 
Beat his ass naked and pee'd in his corner like Verne Troyer 
Ya'll are Eminem backwards, you're menime's 
See he's in a-whole-nother weight class, his slugs your BB's 
Your bean bag bullets, you're full of it, you were dissing his CD's 
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheeties 
No peace treaty's, he's turned into a beast 
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the might DRE 
He's almost famous 

(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 3) 

Now there he goes, in Dre's studio, cupping his balls 
Screaming the wood off the panelling, cussing the paint off the walls 
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads 
He ain't giving 'em shit, he's scissor pinch a penny so hard 
He'll leave a bruise on the brawn so dark 
You can see the mark when it scars, til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out "AHHH!" 
His metaphors and similies ain't similar to them not at all 
If they don't like they can all get fucked, instead of sucking him off 
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by 
Like David Carridy, they can go fuck themselves and just die 
And eat shit while they at it, he's fucking had it 
He's mad at the whole world, so go to hell and build a snowman, girl 
The bullies become bullied, the pussies get pushed 
They better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me 
Cause I ain't looking back only forward, this whole spot blowing 
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it 
And while I'm being poetic, let me get a stork 
And raise the bar higher than my opinion of these women ? 
So bare witness to some biblical shit 
As the cold wind blowing, this world ain't gonna know what hit it, he did it, he made it, he's finally famous!

F-ck you, motherf-cker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga you ain't sh-t
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga you ain't sh-t
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be f-ckin' with you anyway, I need a baller ass, boss ass nigga
You'se a off brand ass nigga, everybody know it, your homies know it, everybody f-ckin' know
F-ck you nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the f-ck is really going on?

This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made end's meet, eatin' your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes without a Mercedes Benz and twenty four inch rims, five percent tint, and air conditioning vents
Hell f-ckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullsh-t, matador, matador, had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious, kept me up watchin'
Pornos and poverty, apology? No
Watch you volunteer it it while people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has it's day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter fact it need interest, matter fact it's nine inches
Matter fact see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin', my consensus
Been relentless, f-ck forgiveness, f-ck your feelings
F-ck your sources, all distortion, if you f-ck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
F-ck you think is bullsh-t, porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is deaf, a state of decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I the picked cotton that made you rich
Now my dick ain't free

I'mma get my Uncle Sam to f-ck you up
You ain't no king 

(Sing about me)


When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em"
I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'm a push it, wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope -


Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it section.80, the message resemble Brenda's Got a Baby
What's crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'm a need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that "Sorry for your loss shit"
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'm a get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...


When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the cent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help me mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm sure not why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'm a rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that put me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "it need to be told
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her soul"
Exactly would have happened if I hadn't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?


Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me



(Dying of Thirst)

Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't?
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently
But they couldn't, bring her back
Who got the footage? channel 9
Cameras looking, it's hard to channel your energy
When you know you're crooked
Banana clip split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams of ballin like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst

What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world, " my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling
Backwards my mama say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"

(oh yeah, oh yeah)
show me a good

show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)


I live for the nights that I can’t remember,
with the people that I won’t forget
spending all the money I just work my ass off
for the things that I won’t regret
I’ve been waiting way too long long long long
tellin’ everybody that I know we about to be on on on on
I ain’t tryin’ look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with
that’s my team, never would I let a woman come between
what we doing right now
this our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream
I’m the Osirus of the shit right now
go to guy for the hits right now
whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now
if you can’t hold your liquor you better quit right now





How ’bout you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed
make the most out of tonight and worry bout it all tomorrow
understand girl, we fam girl
can’t get me right and I do Wayne
Cash money young money pop champagne
Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
people really hate when a backpack rapper get rich
and start livin’ that life dawg
feels like when you gettin’ to that paper hip hop hates ya
they would do it just like I do if they could
its in our nature
ahh, young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer
I came up in the underground though
so I’ma spend another ten thousand for Dilla
call me over rated or creative or too jaded
because any way you put it bitch I made it, YUP




Whoah!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
and like, back and forth because ah
this is.. what you thought it wasn't
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background*
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...


Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smocking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swinging, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman


So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screaming _Fuck the World_ like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck!!
Talking that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck!!


I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Search to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below friezing
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snorting, supporting abortion
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an Afghan




Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screaming like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinning
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfucking style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washing dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smocking weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in




Hey, fuck that!
Outsidaz..
Pace One..
Young Zee..


Yeah boy,

Oh my God, f-cking Bomboclat

all I got to do is point to the spot,
when the bomb drops boy does it drop,
and when it does boy there’s a problem,




Boy dont jinx yourself,
boy I’m Michael Spinks with the belt,
Stringer bell boy, my name rings bells for itself,
I’m sick as hell boy,
you better run and tell someone else,
Bringin hell boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
and to that boy who done said it …,
who said he was better,
lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
i bet he never seen Freddie in a Black and red little sweater,
back better than ever,
the chedder shredder the grater the beef grinder
I’ll settle vendettas a little later,
giving haters incubators, think ya made a mistake,
by saying Shady was ghost, I ain’t even close to the gate
you bout a foot in the grave, stay put and behave
Im bout to turn this f-cking place to Beirut in a day
so hey wouldn’t you say Im the sh-t,
couldn’t agree with you more if you were to say my f-cking sh-t doesn’t stink,
shady f-cking aftermath boy the ship doesn’t sink it just floats int he f-cking water
til we fill up the tank,

Every morning when I wake up, uh, money on my mind
Good times and get caked up, uh, sunshine coming through my blinds
I’m living but, really though, it’s never enough
10 milli on, that's a must, living in California, everybody wanna visit for


Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Yo, it sound clever, come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA


These niggas’ll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck can’t y'all see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It’s a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I’m stressed


You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I’m forever living




My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him - some
3 W’s only for a three day run
Bitch, take them motherfucking panties off, you ain't no - nun, shit
I be living in the sky everytime I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control
California living 'til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know the priority order me Hennessey
And for my niggas OG Killa
Call it Jason Voorhees, boy he's on his job
Boy he sure be having the marks
On they mark, pretty bitches and tire marks
Let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost
For this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh
If I’m wrong then I wanna be right
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it’s not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off




Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, muthafuck your opinion
How many ways am I killing 'em, shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she’ll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I’m in a position of controlling, anything, I buy that ocean
I'm a boss I’ll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this


They want that shit, they often feind
I give it to ‘em, but in between, my time
I gotta tie shoestrings, life’s a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean toward 3 W’s in life
You know blow job need an application, eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like ‘em brown, just like my drink, the fuck you think
I don’t fuck wit’ no hand me downs, see if you fuck then its after me
You know how much I’mma make it work?
You know her dress, slip it in her purse
When you discussed your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first, Cali

Your walkin down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the mornin
And your in a
Nightmare
It's HORRIBLE
Right there's the coroner
Waitin for you
To turn the corner
So he can corner ya
Your a goner
He's ona ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
Cause you can't run anymore
Your done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody
Is watchin in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplading my next plot again
Swallowin the Klonopin
While I'm noddin
In and out on the autumn and
If the ramada inn
Holdin onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at mcdonalds
With
Blood all over me
Dead bodies
Behind the counter
SHIT
Guess I must of just blacked out again
NOT AGAIN

It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel
Until I find hannah montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin
Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin
Every candle on top of the fire place
Mantalin
Grab my flannel and my bandana then
Kiss the naked manakin man again
You can see him standin in my
Front window
If you look in
I'm just a hooligan
Who's use to usin hallicinogens
Causin illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Raise the scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules too
Me
What am I gone do
Had the prodical son
The diabolical one
Very methodical
I slaughtered them

It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and

She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I duck and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I
Had that much fun
Off a half pint of the jack
My last vic and a half
A flashlight
Up kim kardashians ass

I remember the first time
I dismembered a family member
December I think it was
I was having drinks with my cuz
And I wrapped him
In christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin tub
Cut him up into pieces
Then just when I went to drink his
Blood
I thought I outta drink this bath water
That outta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me
That might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams
Just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 am
And here I come
So you should probably run
A secret passage way around here
Man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs
It aint no stoppin me from choppin him up(up)

This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havn’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our seperate ways
So i’m single...
Thinking about what we had and missing you
But I aint santa, I got something for these bad b*tches too
I mean paprazzi on me trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthaf*ckin heart out, its drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me do I ever cross your mind
Because all this sh*t is new to me, i’m learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good
I know that n*ggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed
I promise to stay the same


I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest


(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me

(I'm doin my thing 3x)
I'm tryna be unforgettable...


This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say fo' life yall say fo'ever

The closest your gon get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The names young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’m gon need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers

(?) so whats the deali young done everything in the A but f*ck chillin
So welcome to my life no two days the same
Like for yall to meet the love of my life her names the game


I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest


(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me

Man, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving, yeah I'm leaving, yeah I'm leaving, I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm gone
I had to knock down the wall

I'm leaving, I'm leaving
No looking back when I'm gone
No looking back when I'm gone
No more (x16)

It's over, yeah it over, yeah I'm leaving, I'm gone
I've been doing this wrong, I've been here for too long
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit at home, I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid I'mma die before I get where I'm going
I know I'mma be alone
I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta hit a road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta know the road

Something is said, don't say that again
I just been out and bad from way back when
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
You got something to say, then say that thing

Want you to know how it went

Now and forever, I'll bring it home
Now and forever, I'll bring it home

{just pull the plug!}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
(repeat all 2x)


Hand me an 8
Beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world {i'm here}
And shit on brandy and mase
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill {ahhh}
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot
And people goin' feel me cuz i'ma still be
The mad rapper whether i got money or not {yup}
As long as i'm on pills, and i got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin' makin' fun of your yacht
But i would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in the source
And a wardrobe i can afford
Otherwise i might get sent up back-strike in a ford
And you wonder what the fuck i need more vicadive
Everybody's pissin' me off; even a no limit tank looks like
A middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit i'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would i kill you and jump in a grave and bury myself

{just pull the plug!}
People say that i'm a bad influence

I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than rosco beating james tar senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {ouch ouch}
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that i used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, i kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that i failed 9th grade
You probably think that i'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, i just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
As i fall down a cement flight of steps (ahhhh)
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

{just let it go}
People say that i'm a bad influence

My basic disk will make you take a razor into your wrist
Make you satanistic
Make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains
Are rippin' out your skull so bad
And sew you back and be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "role model," i don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and hailey jade is shady's business
And shady's just an alias i made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when gil was payin me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You may be gettin' a bigger attitude than maybe kim's got
And the shit's almost got the same fate that grady's bitch got
I know that "just the two of us" would make you hate me this much
And just the two of us
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life
It's just words on a mic.
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a show business pig
But the funny shit is that i still go with the bitch

{just let it go}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin' to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure


How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9am in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?


Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas lookin' like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowin' that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's gettin' into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lackin' synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it’s meant to be
Paranoid, always rollin' with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

As i fall deeper into a manic state
Im a prime canidate for the gene to recieve the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of night quil then i salivate
Start off with the night quil like i think i'll just have a taste
Couple sips of that then i gradually graduate 
Too a harder perscription drug called valium like ya that's great
I go to take just one and i end up like having eight 
Now i need something in my stomach cuz i haven't ate
Maybe i'll grab a plate of nachos and i'll have a steak
And you'd think with all i have at stake
Look at my daughters face....
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad i think 
He's acting weird again he's really begining to scare me
Wont shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos 
And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat 

( Hook )
Sometimes i feel so alone,
I just dont know ,feels like i been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as i go home and close the door,
kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place i do,
But i cant and i wont say i tried but i know thats a lie cuz i dont
and why i just dont know..... 


( 2 )
Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer 
Thats the devil in my ear i been sober a fuckin year
And that fucker still talks to me he is all i can fuckin hear
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers
And maybe if i just drink half i'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man i got half a mind
Too have another half of glass of wine sound acinine
Ya i know
But i never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch im about to fall
I missed the couch and down i go looking like a bouncing ball
Shit must have knocked me out cuz i aint feel the ground at all
Wow what the fuck happend last night where am i
Man fuck am i hungover and god damn i got a head ache 
Shit half a vicodin why cant i ? 
" All systems ready for take off please stand by "

So i take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh 
A couple weeks go by it aint even like im getting high
now i need it just not to feel sick ya im getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die 
Oh ya theres an excuse you lose proof so you use 
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin you to get through
It's twelve noon aint no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes
now here i am 3 months later full blown relapse
Just get high untill the kids get home from two homes relax
And since im convinced that im in-somniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so i take 3 naps 
Just to be able to function throughout the day lets see 
That's an ambian each nap how many valium 3
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken 4 years just too put out an album b 
See me and you we almost had the same outcome he
Cuz that christmas you know the nomonia thing
It was bolognya was it the methadone ya think 
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos 
your vcr tape cases with you ambian cr great places to hide aint it
So you can lie to hailie im going beddy bye whitney baby good night elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor

Yo, I can't sing it....

I feel like singin'....

I wanna fuckin' sing...

Cuz I'm happy..
Yeah......I'm happy

Ha Ha, I got my baby back...

Yo, check it out 


Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think theres nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry 

Somtimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wasting my time? 

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 


Somtimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me 


My baby girl  keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, cuz they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side 

I act like shit don't phase me,
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive 

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 




Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singing this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mum didn't abort
Now you probly get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his momma,
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Cuz there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul,
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breaking should I just give up,
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself,
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin'hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted are nothing to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': 
3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to peoples backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', why'd I stick my penis up in?
Woulda ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted 

Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cuz my baby know's that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

We got a young brother to stand for something! 
We got a young brother that believe in the all of us! 
Brother Kendrick Lamar! He's not a rapper, he's a writer, he's an author! 
And if you read between the lines, we'll learn how to love one another! But you can't do that 
Right on 
I said, you can't do that - without loving yourself first 

I done been through a whole lot 
Trial, tribulations, but I know God 
Satan wanna put me in a bow-tie 
Praying that the holy water don't go dry, yeah yeah 
As I look around me 
So many motherfuckers wanna down me 
But ain't no nigga never drown me 
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

Everybody looking at you crazy (Crazy) 
What you gone do? (What you gone do?) 
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving) 
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you) 
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart 
On my sleeve let the runway start 
You know the miserable do love company 
What do you want from me and my scars? 
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence 
How many times our potential was anonymous? 
How many times the city making me promises? 
So I promise this 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street 
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police 
And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends 
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme, yup 
These days of frustration keep y'all on ducking rotation 
I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum basis 
Dreams of realities peace 
Blow steam in the face of the beast 
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now 
The strong in me, I still smile 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

Walk my barefeet (Walk my barefeet) 
Down, down valley peak (Down, down valley peak) 
I keep my fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum) 
I keep my heart undone (My heart undone) 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

I went to war last night 
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic 
I'm a do it 'til I get it right 
I went to war last night 
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent 
Duckin' every other blessin', l can never see the message 
I can never take the lead, I can never bob and weave 
For my nigga that be letting 'em annihilate me 
And the sound is moving in a meteor speed 
From a 100 to a billion lay my body in the street 
Keep my money in the ceiling let my mama know I'm free 
Give my story to the children and the lesson they can read 
And the glory to the feeling of the only unseen 
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!" 

I lost my head, I must've misread what the good book said 
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside 
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry

That's the shit I'm talking about though
Like you changed up
You don't even fucking link nobody no more
You just dash me away like a cyattie
Yo, you cheesed me dog

Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it’s dark out 
To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss ya
Shit’ll come back around and get ya
Crazy like all my niggas
Crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the BAR exam
I drove in the snow for you
You probably don’t remember half the shit a nigga did for you

Ya, you ain’t really fuck with me way back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
How bout now?
Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?

Always been daddy’s little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain’t even say thank you
I had no money
Left from back when I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like “who’s this?”
I be like “me, girl.”
You be like “oh word, true shit?”
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel I have it like that
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I’m not even Christian I still went to church that year
Guess, I just had to pretend that year
I ain’t even see my friends that year
Places that I should’ve been

You ain’t really fuck with me way back then
But how bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
How bout now?
Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?

Why do I feel so alone? 
Like everybody passing through the studio ,
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role ,
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know,
And I don't have the heart to give these, 
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go, 
So they stick around kicking out feedback, 
And I entertain it as if I need that, 
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that,
My privacy about the only thing I need back but, 
It's hard to think of them polite flows, 
Mr. Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes, 
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes, 
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed, 
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows, 
Life was so full, 
Now this shit just being lipo'd, 
Always said I'd say it all on the right track, 
But in this game you only lose when you fight back, 
Black diamond bracelets, 
Showing you the basics, 
I can't live and hold the camera, 
Someone gotta tape this, 
I make hits unlike a bitch, 
That's married I ain't miss, 
24 hours from greatness, 
I'm that close, 
Don't ever forget the moment, 
You began to doubt, 
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out, 
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South, 
Watchin' whole show, 
Embarrassed to pull my camera out, 
And my mother embarrassed, 
To pull my Phantom out, 
So I park about 5 houses down, 
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown, 
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around, 
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus, 
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness, 
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus, 
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless, 
And promoters try to get me out to they club, 
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how, 
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, 
Standing with my next girl, 
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now, 
And shit could get weird unless they all down, 
And so I stay clear.

We from a small town, 
Everybody talks and everybody listen, 
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing, 
I've always been something that these labels can't buy, 
Especially if they tryin' to take a peice of my sou,l 
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez "Damn Drake fly" 
And he just be like "Silly mother fucker I know" 
That was your bad, 
How could you pass up on 'em? 
He just take them records, 
And he gas up on 'em, 
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em, 
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em, 
Oh they did Po, 
At least they tried to, 
And that's what happens, 
When you spitting what's inside you, 
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video, 
And they think they can market you, 
However they decide to nahh, 
But Forty told me to do me, 
And don't listen to anybody that knew me, 
'Cause to have known me would, 
Mean that there's a new me, 
And if you think I changed in the slightest, 
Could of fooled me, 
Boy in my city I'm da 2-3, 
Drug dealers live vicariously through me, 
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy, 
I'm just not the social type, 

And campus life is crazy understand, 
I could get money with my eyes closed, 
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo, 
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll, 
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know, 
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will, 
I got new shit, 

I'm gettin' better still, 
Little niggas put my name in they verses, 
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal, 
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill, 
And I think this got this "Making of a Legend" feel, 
Problem with these other niggas they, 
Ain't never real, 
Yea ... that's all I can say.

I’m more than just an option
Hey, Hey, Hey
refuse to be forgotten
Hey, Hey, Hey
I took a chance with my heart
Hey, Hey, Hey
And I feel it taking over


I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I bet if i give all my love then
nothing's gonna tear us apart

I’m more than just a number
Hey, Hey, Hey
I doubt you’ll find another
Hey, Hey, Hey
so every single summer
Hey, Hey, Hey
I'll be the one that you remember


I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I bet if i give all my love then
nothing's gonna tear us apart

It’s more than just a mission
Hey, Hey, Hey
you hear but you don’t listen
Hey, Hey, Hey
You better pay attention
Hey, Hey, Hey
and get what you been missing


too many times I’ve been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I’m done waiting, there’s nothing left to do
but give all I have to you and
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I bet if i give all my love then
nothing's gonna tear us apart 

I bet if i give all my love then
nothing's gonna tear us apart

Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do


All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting, I told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

 

What money got to do with it 
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image? 
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it 
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit 
Hol' up 
Get it back 
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it 
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what? 

If I was the president 
I'd pay my mama's rent 
Free my homies and them 
Bulletproof my Chevy doors 
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord 
Who ever thought? 
Master take the chains off me 

Life can be like a box of chocolate 
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious 
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it 
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive 
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics 
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant 
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious 
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges 
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is 
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it 
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this 
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal 
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god 
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged 
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards 
You lookin' at artists like the harvests 
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them 
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry 
I should've listened what my grandmama said to me 

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga 
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass 
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga 
Oh now, slow down 

And once upon a time in a city so divine 
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid 
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said 

What I'm s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks? 
The convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips 
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor 
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for 
Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this? 
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist 
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it 
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds? 
No more livin' poor, meet my .44 
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor 
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers 
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey 
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay 
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA 
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor? 
Well that's me at these awards 
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy 
She said... 

And once upon a time in a city so divine 
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused 
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse 
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie 
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey 
Hollywood's nervous 
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone till November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house takin' no calls
I done hit the stride, got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the wri-wri-wri-wri




Cloud nine, Kendrick Lamar, uh
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I started questioning God, what is my purpose?
He say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up man, I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again


What am I gonna do? Gotta have faith
Life is too much, understood? Where is your faith?
Oh, faaaaaaaith...
All you need is the size of a mustard seed


Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't bout shit, that nigga ain't bout shit
Spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature
and maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice
that said the Devil is a lie, make a better choice
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
with them crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her section 8
Then lost her faith again




Kendrick, I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
This about how faith works, yeah, murk it...
I had dreams of holding a nine-milla to raise Killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas ensue
The rat's lurking, vulture's circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
to make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach cloud nine, that's what my niggas bout
But it never rain in California 'less them pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Ray Charles voice




This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering is there really a God?
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
But whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
and wonder why I ain't never caught that feeling before
Maybe they know him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know is that he's real and he lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because he's testing your faith again

I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
than die and find out there really is, think about it 

All aboard, okay, next stop, my basement… ha ha
I'll meet you down there

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Haters getting mad, they done had enough of shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touche me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's a no-no who even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I ought to just be honest but

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert, and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad, when I call them both faggots
It's all these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the weiner schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
Body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him
Homie, I'm the sheisse, pass Doctor Dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussys queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre

That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A even got a bidet
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator 



It's not me and you
It's not me it's you
Your reckless and you know it
They don't love you like I do
Say you're moving over, like guess that's just the motion

I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

I don't have a fuck to give
I been moving state to state
In my leather and my Tims
Like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chubb
That's my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
That's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling
'Cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone

But, I guess that's just the motion
And your phone doesn't ring when they got everything
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

Yeah,
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
'Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her
And she know it
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help

But, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh) 

(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.)
Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Drawin' a Blank like
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.

Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma do that for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()

Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
Imeet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

()

Better watch out sucker now I got ya where I want ya,
onslaught, coming and Im packing in my lunch up,
bunch a missile launcher and a bunch a contra,
van van full of ganja, now come on jump,
man stop marchin marshall on my gotcha,
doin’ the cha cha and the kucharcha with a quadri-plegic,
boogieing down to Frank Sinatra,
Lyndsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya,
who da knew the puda do ta me whats its done,
such cynicism when this isn’t in my system,
blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lip son,
so much on my hands, i got to give my kids a fist pump,
Chris-to-pher Reeves swimming in my swim trunks,
Mister, “help me” whats he said to me and then sunk,
women skinning them and cutting them up in chunks,
in comes the woman with cocoa butter skin ones,


Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-buffalo bill,
skin em up, hym em,
sew em up in those kilts, up in those kilts,
upa upa up in those kilts,
man you don’t want to go up in those hills,
up in those hills, uppa up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill,
buffa-buffalo bill,


Always, you can see em lurking in the hallways,
carcasues of caucasion females in his draw space,
how the hell did he fit em all in such a small space,
hide em in the wall but how long will the dry wall take,
well f-ck it then, I got nothing but time, I’ll wait,
until its dries for the moment i guess your all safe,
after I sand it and buff it I guess that I’ll paint,
my chainsaw’s outta gas my regular saw aint,
now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling,
you can even hear the evil spirits coming from within,
someones in, the back of my damn house rummaging,
its a girl, she looks pretty thin but I want to skin,
been on the hunt again, when will it ever end,
Evelyn why you trying to fight you will never win,
http://www.elyricsworld.com/buffalo_bill_lyrics_eminem.html
severing legs, arms, damn there goes another limb,
pull the lever then trap door, death is evident




Now what you know about Buffalo Bill,
nothing so chill,
f-cking hoe, you better f-cking hold still,
make sure none of that lotion in that bucket don’t spill,
cut em gut em and just keep stuffing those girls,
man I think she had enough of those pills,

sedate her, then I wait her come back later just to clutch on those steel blades
braids, baby when I cut ya dont squeal
I hate the loud noises I f-cking told you,
I keep hearing voices like
wouldn’t you like to go and get ya put ya knife
and push it right through it while ya put ya shishkebab skewer
into a barbecue or would ya do to her what you usually do to a girl who’s skins newer,


In a World of Sin doer this is turning into a torment tournament of sorts,
Christmas Ornament you are,


I”ll be sure to Gensu ya til there’s no more skin to ya,
boo ya who ya think you f-cking with,
duck because here he comes again,



These girls aint got nothing on you
uhh, say baby I had to mention
that if you were a star youd be the one Im searching for
other girls they got attention
but I just always feel like there in need of something you got
obvious you're pretty
heard that your a student working weekends in the city
trying to take you out girl, hope your not too busy
and if theres nothing wrong, got this little song
for you to get ready to
put those f-cking heels on and work it girl
let that mirror show you what your doing
put that f-cking dress on and work it kind of vicious
like somebodys taking pictures


shut it down down down
you would shut it down down down
you be the baddest girl around round round
and they notice they notice
you would shut it down down down
you be the baddest girl around round round
and they notice they notice
you would shut it, hey oh
these girls aint got nothing on you nothing on you

What you need

I can be (I can be)
your everything
(who knew)
them other n-ggas
just wanna hit it but if they had it
wouldnt know what to do with it
(and together)


we shut it down down down
they know we shut it down down down
your the baddest girl around


TMZ concrete loop
you shut that muthf-cker down down
ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
you shut that muthaf-cker down down down
oh yeah,
yes indeed, you shut it down down
Drizzy, The American Dream

You shut that sh-t down
(down down down)
you shut it down
you shut it down
you shut it down
you shut it down
you shut it, ohh

you looking good girl
go go go get em girl,
go go go go hit em girl
go go go go go go
you shut it down

So this is it?
This is what I wished for
This isnt how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just this shit'd be different
But something changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffing it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldnt quit
I just wanted a little bit
Them it turned me to a monster 
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert
I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sowing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no one for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in between
You either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3 years later they go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just aint pass yet
A couple more years that shit'll be illmatic 
And 8 years later I'm still at it
Divorced, remarried
A felon,a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk


So be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold
I said be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might ot know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold

I got a letter from a fan that said
He's been praying for me
Everyday, and for some reason it's been weighing on my mind heavy
Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But some thing told me to go ahead and open it but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you
You didn't pray for me when i was local
And as i lay these vocals
I think of all the shit i had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you atleast a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but i've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride hasn't it?
Just watching it from an opposite stand point
Man boy's got to look... nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now on how
To describe this shit
It's just like  a vibe you get
Go ahead  and bop to it just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit



(uhh, Young Money, Yea)

:
I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last year, who the f**k are yall?
I swear it feels like the last few nights

Oh, yeah, thats right, Im doin me

And this what Ima do til its over
Til its over

1
Bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, f**k are yall thinkin?
Makin sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin
Bout to set it off, set it off in this B**ch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldntve drove, tell me how Im gettin home
You too fine to be layin down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing Ive ever known
Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these n***as
All I needs a f**king red jacket with some zippers
Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers
I did it overnight, it couldnt happen any quicker
Yall know them? Well, f**k it, me either
But point the biggest skeptic out, Ill make him a believer
It wouldnt be the first time I done it, throwin hundreds
When I should be throwin ones, b**ch, I run it (Ah)

One thing bout music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that sh*t that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, its just game
Its just what comes with the fame, and Im ready for that, Im just sayin
But I really cant complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin Ima quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
Im really too young to be feelin this old
Its about time you admit it, who you kiddin, man?
Man, nobodys never done it like I did it (Ugh)

-Isaac Martinez
I smoke to get high because
This world is so low
and i drank, sip and pop p**ls 
till i dose off

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe

Look inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt and never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don’t know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


I’m trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I’m looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I’ll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


You ain’t heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don’t you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3′s in the air I can see you are – in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I’ll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it’s alive
My new year’s resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say – Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated
against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,
give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the
evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but
they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...



I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm
cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I
never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me
inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a
multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father
must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,
no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I
couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it
work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm
man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest
shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot
Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...



Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you
think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'
your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'
through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of
Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew
up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made
that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your
gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna
know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but
you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't
admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare
you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in
hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess
what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...



Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And I think it's changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture, the trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagle's, an Aries coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
(Real talk) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ride around his block
All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
Welcome to Detroit, mothafucka

Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D
On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas say
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
And to think y'all hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
I had K's in front ya school, but I ain't go to Kettering
Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son
And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody

Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit

And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me
I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch
180 degrees in here trying to wait for the cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah when it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
Sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it
It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters when you came here?
And I came to kill 'em

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

What up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody
Hey Em let me get that instrumental
Take it down to the hood
Let the little hoodies get this remix crackin'
Detroit

Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
Some shit about a message you left 
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" 
This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! 
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre 
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way) 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch 

So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
We can fly over the border "Let's go" 
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
 (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri 
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste 
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Plus he raps with his regular voice 
 (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys 
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ 
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! 
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
Do somethin'! At least one punchline 
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs 
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither 
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!) 
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Intro] 
Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging 

 
I'm withholding my anger 
Though I'd like to be the strangler 
Of this punkass little pussy's puny neck 
It's my right to insist 
That he acknowledge my existence 
But he just displays complete lack of respect 
That's what he says to himself 
As he uses magazines to trash me 
As he sits with both feet up at his desk 
Smokes a bag of his weed 
And starts imagining things 
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed 
And in his jealousy and envy 
It just whirls him in a frenzy 
As he turns on MTV and sees my face 
He don't exist in this world 
So he just twists and he twirls 
Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a race 
And it's destroying him slowly 
Cuz he does not even know me 
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes 
So he just tortures himself 
He has no fortune and wealth 
So he extorts someone else to get his dough 
And now he's acting like a bully 
So he tries to push and pull me 
But he knows that he can't pull me so he's mad 
He has no choice but to scream 
And raise his voice up at me 
Cuz it annoys him to see that I ain't scared 

 
You aint no motherfucking (bully) 
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking (bully) 
I won't allow it, aint no coward to no (bully) 
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully) 
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...) 

And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...) 

 
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies 
No more unfortunately 
There's so many motherfuckers that just are 
They just keep pounding at me 
Now that I'm down with 50 
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja  
But his ass is such a puppet 
Irv could stick his whole hand up it 
And just make him say what he wants him to say 
But shook-ass Irv's on a string 
And Irv's so nervous that he 
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay 
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough 
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf 
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down 
But our building's made out of bricks 
So you ain't taking out shit 
I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown 
So now you try to pull a race car 
And it backfires in your face hard 
Cuz you know we don't play that black and white shit 
Plus this guy that you fucked 
When you was ecstasied up 
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch 

 
You must be taking to much (E...) 

 
Now what bothers me the most 
About hip-hop is we so close 
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac 
We just lost Jam Master J 
Big L got blasted away 
Plus we lost Bugs, Slayed Son, and Freaky Ta 
It's like a never-ending cycle 
That just seems to come full circle 
Everyone's gotta be so fucking hard 
I'm not excluding myself 
Cuz I been stupid as well 
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart 
But as we grow as men 
We learn to let shit go, but then again 
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand 
We all got reps to uphold 
When someone steps on our toes 
It's no exception, it goes for every man 
But if Irv really gave a fuck 
About Ja like he claims he does 
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs 
But he just keeps feeding him pills 
So if that E doesn't kill him 
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed 
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight 
If the situation escalates 
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game 
And if I get killed for this rap 
I got a million in cash 
That says I will get you back in Halie's name 

 
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...) 

 
Get at me, dawg 
Holla

Come on hey hey we goin' to the beach 
grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat. 
Where's Mama? 
She's takin' a little nap in the trunk 
Oh that smell dada must have run over a skunk. 
now I know what you're thinkin': 
it's kind of late to go swimmin' 
but you know your mama she's one of those types of women 
who does crazy things and if she don't get her way she'll throw a 
fit 
don't play with daddy's toy knife, honey, let go of it 
and don't be so upset, why you actin' bashful? 
don't you wanna help dadda build a sand castle? 
and mama said she wants to show how far she can float, 
and don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat 
it's just a little scratch it don't hurt, 
her was eatin' dinner while you was sleepin' and spilled ketchup on 
her shirt 
mama's messy, isn't she, we'll let her wash off in the water 
and me and you can play by ourselves, can't we? 
just the two of us (sung) repeat 8-9 times 
there's a place called heaven and a place called hell, 
a place called prison and a place called jail, 
and dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one, 
'cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson 

and you don't want a brother do ya? (Na) 
maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better, I'll 
explain it to ya. 
but for now we'll just say that mama was real, real bad 
she was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad 
but I still feel sad that I put her in time out, 
sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin' to climb out 
I told you it's okay, hey hey, wanna baba? 
take a night-night, nana-boo, goo-goo ga-ga 
humma goo-goo caca, dad'll change your dighty, 
clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty. 
you're dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water, 
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter. 
just the two of us (sung) 
wake up sleepy head we're here, 
before we play, we're gonna take mama for a little walk along the 
pier. 
baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea, 
mama's too sleepy to hear you screamin' in her ear, 
that's why you can't get her to wake, 
but don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mama at the bottom of the 
lake, 
here, you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock? 
we'll tie it to her footsies then will roll her off the dock. 
ready now, here we go, on the count of three, 
one, two, three...weeeeeeeeee 
there goes mama splashin' in the water, 
no more fightin' your dad, no more restrainin' order, 
no more step dada, no more new brother, 
blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her, 
we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk, 
but first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk, 
just the two of us (sung)




(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
> Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will serve you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?


(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right


(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right
Aw Yeah

Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish
Hit this house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know its vacant, ya bish
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherene then went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Parked the car and then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel


Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 at the school
You know big ballin with my homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality we poor, ya bish
Another casualty at war, ya bish
Two bullets in my uncle tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish
That Louie's Burger never be the same
A louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin'
Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hoping all of em offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gone crash it when nobodies home


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel


Be the last one out to get this dough? , No Way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes?, No Way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No Way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No Way


Imagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, everyday I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em, get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel



How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself "why do you hurt me?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know that you love me baby
Time to take you away from me...
Only over my dead body...


I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Mmm, mmm
F*ck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some 
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from

Yeah, you know me well nigga, yeah 
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the p-ssy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yea
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again 
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine 
And I be hearing sh*t you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yea
It's been that way from the beginning I just been playing, I aint even notice that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright


I know, I know that you love me baby
The time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body


You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And f-ck you to the niggas that thinks it's there time, yea
Don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever gave you a star boy
Or you wanna be a mother fuckin' funny guy
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart boy
Yea, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel now more than ever
My city love me like I'm Mac Dre in The Bay
Second Album I'm pack paving away
The backpackers are back on the band wagon like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby's mom last night
We took a picture Last night
I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And lost everything that I came with
Yea, feel like I've been here before
I still got 10 years to go, ha
And this is the only sound you should fear
And these kids where crowns over here & everything is alright...





Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black, white or a albino yeah
You can have corn rows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go *blah
From outta nowhere, you might find your career
Come to an *err and I'm just like (Oh Yeah)

Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let em talk shit, cause they talk shit
Knowing deep down, they really just wanna squash it
Cause no one wants to walk around, stepping in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum'
We just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm
Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiya'
Meanwhile your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
Right in the ass with KY, yes sir!
So full of joy, boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you
'Yea boi don't curr'



See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)

And where is G-Unit at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)



Ya homie got clapped on, man I don't care
The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is dogg, man life's not fair
Ya friend should've know not to front round here
Listen kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear
They'll strip yo ass of your jewels, right here
Man I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
Ya girl's a freak, man sometime we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You prolly heard about me, I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin, like I'm running for mayor
riding, winding, dining and shining, know what I'm saying
I ain't got time for fucking around, and horseplaying
I'm making hits, my homies taking hits, who's staying



See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to pick it
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch


Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long


We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) shake your body


Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khaki's pressed, Nike shoes just crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made Em just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in dang, bang bang
Yes sir Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang dang
P-p-p-pow chicka pow chicka wow wow
Got your gal blowin' up a val-v-v-v-val-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now hoe




We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) get your vials




And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard, drugs are though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you a loan, car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers, shit head with a potty mouth
Get the bar soap lathered, Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl you’re fixin' to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd man
You birdbrain baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you’re a swallow
Word, Rick word man you heard, but don’t be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam





Just the two of us.. 


Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us..

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us..

If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question: 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two) 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question: 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
Want you look to your left and right, ask you friends 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me? 
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be? 
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime? 
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line? 
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off 
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car 
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K. Lamar 
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog 
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson 
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome 
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing 
But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question: 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And if you riding with me 

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her? 
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur? 
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt? 
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? 
Can you be immortalised without your life being expired? 
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time? 
Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent? 
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending? 
How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness? 
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended 
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing 
What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it's mentioned? 
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson 
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom 
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message 
That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And if you riding with me 

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues 
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you 
That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson 
I went to Robben's Island analysing, that's where his cell is 
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me 
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be? 
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs 
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow 
Murphy's Law, generation X, will I ever be your ex? 
Floss off a baby step, mobbed by the mouth a bit 
Pause, put me under stress 
Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect 
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall 
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead? 
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red? 
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shooter you assassin 
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it's Michael Jackson, oh 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga 

"I remember you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence 
Sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power, full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screaming in the hotel room 
I didn't wanna self destruct 
The evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went running for answers 
Until I came home 
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt 
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one 
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination 
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned 
The word was respect 
Just because you wore a different gang colour than mines 
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man 
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets 
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us 
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another nigga" 

Shit and that's all I wrote 
I was gonna call another nigga but, it ain't really a poem, I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to. Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you, I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground. What you mean ‘bout that, what the ground represent? 

The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil. That's how I see it, my word is bond. I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm saying, wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you know what I'm saying it's gonna be like… there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich 

Aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that's rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities? 

I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin', I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I'm saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying. I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us 

And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? 

By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true. You know what I'm saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying, I was noticing, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it's no problem, you know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know. I'm finna go straight through 

Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? 

I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been threatened with resistance it's been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back 

Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down 

In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. And you don't wanna fight no more. And if you don't believe me you can look around, you don't see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas 

That's crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today? 

Shit, I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be bloodshed for real. I don't think America can know that. I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka. You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen 

That's crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people don't understand how important it is. Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy I'mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes 

Because the spirits, we ain't really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us 

Damn 

I wanted to read one last thing to you. It's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says: 

"The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it 
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city 
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive 
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly 
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar 
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits 
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him 
He can no longer see past his own thoughts 
He's trapped 
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city 
The result? 
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant 
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle 
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same." 

What's your perspective on that? 
Pac, Pac, Pac

Hol it, Hol it, Hol it, Hol it, Hol it

Nobody really likes us except for us

Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now


You still love me?
Take this. 
You ready? 1.. 2.. 3! 


The more you, put me through,
The more it makes me wanna come back to you,
You say you hate me, I just love you more,
You don't want me, I just want you more,
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
I know it's sad but it's making me happy,
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
Cause you love me, and I love you more.


It's sick, but who could ever predict,
We'd be doin' the same shit,
We say we do it for our baby but we don't,
We do it for us, it's lust,
Cause neither one of us trusts each other,
So we fuck 'til we bust,
Then we cuss each other, out,
We know what it's about,
Shout 'til I throw you out the house,
You throw me out the house,
I throw you on the couch,
Punch you in the mouth,
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,
And apologize after,
Laughter, pain, it's insane,
We're back in the same chapter again,
And it's sad but it's true,
When I'm layin' here with you,
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.




Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,
It makes me wanna just take you,
And just throw you on the bed,
And fuck you like I don't even know you,
You fuck other people, and I fuck other people,
You a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,
We're both evil in our ways,
But neither one of us would ever admit it,
Cause one of us would have one up on the other,
So forget it,
We can make accusations, people spread rumors,
But they ain't got proof,
'Til they do it's just the two of us,
It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me,
But you gotta believe me to a degree,
Cause true indeed if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,
Yeah I would cause the sex is too damn good,
If I ran who would I run to,
That would be this soft and warm,
So it's off and on, usually more off than on,
But at least we know that we share this common bond,
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on,
I hope, the only reason that I cope,
Is cause of that fact,
And plus I can bust in that,
And that's why...




I could never understand it,
That's why I don't try,
From junior high until we both die,
It's silly ho why must we try,
Is it really so rough,
That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,
Try to pull each other's legs,
Until the other begs,
We're liein' to ourselves,
That's the beauty of it yeah,
Cause we truly love each other,
That's why we always fight,
And all we do is shove each other,
Every other fuckin' night,
And it's clear it ain't gonna change,
It's pent up rage,
We both have,
We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,
We've both been,
Someone else's someone else,
Problem is neither one wants help,
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed,
Our family's mixed up,
There's a baby sister in the mix,
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,
On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,
All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,
But I won't be made a fool of,
If this is true love,
You wouldn't do what,
You did last time,
You wouldn't screw up,
This time,
Cause this time girl,
I'm telling you what,
You do it again I'm fucking you up,
No matter what...


What you say, what you do,
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,
No matter where you run, I'll be right there,
Right behind you, in your nightmares,
All the flowers, and the candy,
All the times that you threw it back at me,
You told me you hate me, you're gonna hate me more,
When you find out, can't escape me whore.




Fuck dat
8 doobies to the face
Fuck dat
12 bottles in the case
Nigga, fuck dat
2 pills and a half, wait
Nigga, fuck dat
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist


Man, I swear
My nigga trippin off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him vicodin
Hope to take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of section 8
And you feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are
A loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins
Make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin off
My generation sippin cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition
That the world is bout to end
Who gives a fuck? we never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
A melody and some hoes
Playstation and some drank
Technology bumping Soul
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd, that's product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black
She black too
Purple label on her back
But that dap
Is like when she take it straight to the head
Then she look at me
She got AD-HD




Like woah oh oh woah (x4)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(They always told me ad-hd did it)


And then she started
And then she started
Feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
Beg you pardon
Oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23
Ok then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said where my drink at?
I'mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors
Have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds
Closed the screen, jumbotron
Made it to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it
Then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That ADHD crazy






You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six
Just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, dro, hoes
Whatever you like
You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light

You know a lotta girls be...thinking my songs about them, but
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...


Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say you da fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate,
Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the matt and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

Cause,



Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffin theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 

Uhh, ah yea

Everything black, I don't want black 
I want everything black, I ain't need black 
Some white some black, I ain't mean black 
I want everything black 

Six in the mornin', fire in the street 
Burn, baby burn, that's all I wanna see 
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain 
It's such a shame they may call me crazy 
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin' 
But homie you made me 
Black don't crack my nigga 

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses 
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it 
I'm African-American, I'm African 
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village 
Pardon my residence 
Came from the bottom of mankind 
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide 
You hate me don't you? 
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture 
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey 
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me 
And this is more than confession 
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion 
I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it 
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin' 
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot 

I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black 
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black 
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black 
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks 
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back 
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block 
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black 
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that 

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society 
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me 
Curse me till I'm dead 
Church me with your fake prophesyzing that I'mma be just another slave in my head 
Institutionalize manipulation and lies 
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes 
You hate me don't you? 
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself 
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt 
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out 
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah 
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special 
CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you? 
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'? 
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree 
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred 
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification 
I'm African-American, I'm African 
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan 
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius 
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all 
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you? 
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you 
I can tell cause your ways deceitful 
Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle 
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him 
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war 
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy 
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door 
Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score 
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers 
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers" 
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day 
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays 
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements 
Or watch BET cause urban support is important 
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street? 
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me? 
Hypocrite!

I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence 
Sometimes, I did the same 

If these walls could talk

Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway 
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out 
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey 
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play 
And shes plays only when you tell her no 


If these walls could talk 
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you 
If these walls could talk 
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it 

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good 
No boat I float better than he would 
No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth 
But your flood can be misunderstood 
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment 
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension 
Me? I’m just a tenant 
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute 
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation 
Interior pink, color coordinated 
I interrogated every nook and cranny 
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me 
These walls want to cry tears 
These walls happier when I’m here 
These walls never could hold up 
Everytime I come around demolition might crush 

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep 
Yelling at me continuously I can see 
Your defense mechanism is my decision 
Knock these walls down that’s my religion 
Walls feeling like they ready to close in 
I suffocate then catch my second wind 
I resonate in these walls 
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls 
I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in 
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest 
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them 
I’m not involved I’d rather diss them 
I’d rather call all you put your wall up 
Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush 

If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late 
Your destiny accepted your fate 
Burn accessories and stash them where they are 
Take the recipe, the bible and god 
Wall telling you that commissary is low 
Race wars happening no calling CO 
No calling your mother to save you 
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable 
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch 
Walls is telling me you a bitch 
You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them 
That sentence so important 
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me" 
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me 
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life 
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night 
So when you play this song rewind the first verse 
About me abusing my power so you can hurt 
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny 
About me and her in the after hours of the morning 
About her baby daddy currently serving life 
And how she think about you until we meet up at night 
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her 
And how she fucking on a famous rapper 
Walls could talk 

I remember you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence 
Sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screaming in a hotel room

Ay yo DJ respect let’s get em
Veterans like how dare all of this arrogance
What you expect when all they do draw comparisons between us and Americans
And tell me go hard well I am going harder now 
Bumping Shawn Carter cause there aint a Shawn Carter now feel me
Get with it I’m trying to overthrow a nation using Phade To Black as a niggas only motivation
I’m picking and choosing an army and thinking of moving my talent disprove it
Let’s show her heads who’s in
And if you must know this year I’m going for the gusto plus though seat feeling like a bus load
So take me as I am I have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that parade love me
I’m a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for trinity Chris word
See my role models role with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough then the whole lotto
 So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mamoses with the clique quad
What up Nikko Jordan Lucky and TJ nicknamed the night fox clique we take it easy
You prime ministers claim you repping the team I need a mother fucking president to represent me

Just the two of us.. 


Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Just the two of us..

If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby


I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25 sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?


One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt?
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

 


It’s like I'm in the dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won’t work
All it takes is one song on the radio you’re right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burned, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don’t suppose an explanation I’m owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I’d never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
'bout to go through’s tougher than anything I have suffered
Can’t think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"


I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy


And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pain of resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you?
The cause to my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone




I've been driving around your side of the town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders before hand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost half of a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back as they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it we are in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by Eminem
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
(Help, police!!)
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, hope you can swim good!
Now say you hate homos again!


I also represent anyone normally seen on the end of these jokes of a beat
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Backs to the wall, I’m stacking up all them odds, toilets cock
Yeah ‘cause I’m talking a lot of shit but I’m backing it all up
But in my head there’s a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I’m the ringing in your ears
I’m the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I’m your time that’s almost up that you haven’t acknowledged
Grab for some water but I’m that pill that’s too jagged to swallow
I’m the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult there
With the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mather’s the rapper’s persona’s have a facade and 
Matthew and Stan’s just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it’s gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them,
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don’t stop after they call you
The biggest laughing stock of rap who can’t call it quits
But it’s time to walk away
I’m ever guilt trip the baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time, I’m back
Before it fades into black and it’s all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers’ left off

Study long, study wrong, nigga 
Hey, y'all close that front door, ya'll let flies in this motherfucker 
Close that door! 
My OG up in this motherfucker right now 
My pops man with the bottle in his hand, actin' a fool 
Hey, hey, babe check it out, Imma tell you what my mama had said, she like: 

I could spot you a mile away 
I could see your insecurities written all on your face 
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say 
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang 
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same 
Circus acts only attract those that entertain 
Small talk, we know that it's all talk 
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name 

Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me 
Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me 
Say you got to burn your stash to impress me 
It's all in your head, homie 
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me 
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me 
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me 
You sound like the feds, homie 

You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie 
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
You ain't gotta try so hard 

And the world don't respect you and the culture don't accept you 
But you think it's all love 
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done 
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one 
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex) 
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex) 
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex 
Let me put it back in proper context 

What do you got to offer? 
Tell me before you we off ya, put you deep in the coffin 
Been allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit 
Instead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is 
Niggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie 
This is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts 
You can never persuade me 
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them 
Or you, the truth you love to bend 
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho 
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though 
So loud, rich niggas got low money 
And loud, broke niggas got no money 
The irony behind it is so funny 
And I seen it all this past year 
Pass on some advice we feel



Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh-t
When I hear talkin, I just dont know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams who Im racing with
You can see Im pacin it so that Im always chasin it
Wayne put me right here, thats who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own, but its lookin like July 4th
But I just wish theyd let you try it first
This time Im really goin off, fireworks



When I go off like July 4th
feels like a fire, Got to go higher
Its your revelation, my sweet celebration
light me like a rocket, cause can't nothing stop it
all I see is fireworks,
all i see is fireworks
every night its fireworks
every night its fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off like fireworks


I got this one girl, you know, in my life
so I say in this song, I say
I'm just such a gentleman
you should give it up for me
look at how I'm placing al my napkins and my cutlery
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you f-ck with me
who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me
yeh, I kept my wits about me luckilly
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
and you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
but I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
what an experience
you coulda been the one but it wasnt that serious
their was smoke in the air before now its me cleaing it
that felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
now I can see it in her eyes
Fireworks!

 


Everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that I still listen
and he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my Realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city I let her explore
ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close
yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first, that's why I'm really going off, Fireworks!

If I die all I know is I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way
Money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'on't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'mma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D, I'm the holy one
Yeaaah, you know wassup
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong


I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdose on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it,(aye) please don't do it,(aye) cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,


Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind.
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize it happened over time
She says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you suppose to do
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions.
You know the game even got it like that.
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that.
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind (mind, mind, mind)
Tell em' I apologize it happened over time (time, time, time)
They know

Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who"
And she like, "who are we kidding? You're 27, you just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me ,momma
What more they want from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough
Ir making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life




I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy


Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal


Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, "Baby girl, fall in line, " ok
Made a million, off of denim
Fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "I'll nigga alert! I'll nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)




I touched down in '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with' us and we don't fuck with' y'all, it's no different over on this side
God damn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, "You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help"
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,
Ya'll keep talking 'bout who next,
But I'm about how big as it gets,
I swear ya'll just wastin' ya'll breath,
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,
I'm a make it last forever,
It's not your time 'cause I ain't done yet,
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,
I was made for all of this shit,
And I'm on the road box office sales,
I'm getting paid for all of this shit,
Ask you to please excuse my table manners,
I was making room for the table dancers,
'Cause if we judging off your advances,
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!




HOE, SHUT THE fuck UP
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rest do
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythang
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit
Good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth
Drink a fifth
Load the nine
Leave you split, in the half
Smoke a half, Need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me
And I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'
Lil' bitch


Oh Me. Oh Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that, that ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)
I'm blessed than a motherfucker,
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin' nervous, clutchin' they chests like a motherfucker,
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail,
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man,
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do. 


Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Yeah
Too late
I cant keep chasing em
Taking my life like that
Caught in a change
25 to life


I dont think she understands the sacrifices that I made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I wouldve stayed
But ive already wasted over half of my life I wouldve laid
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
Imma take control of this relationship
Command it, and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while ive stayed
Faithfull all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I aint heard you yet
Not even once say you apreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so dont hold your fucking breath
You know what youve done no need to go in depth
I told you, youd be sorry if I fucking left
Id laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny aint it, you neglected me
Did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but its,


Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life


I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that aint good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Till I snap
Dont think im loyal
All I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Dont I give you enough of my time
You dont think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why im married to you still man I dont know
But tonight im serving you with papers
Im divoricing you
Go marry someone else and make em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat em like you dont need them and they aint worthy of you
Feed em the same shit that you made me eat
Im moving on forget you oh,
Now im special, I aint felt special when I was with you
All I ever felt was dissed
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
Its ridiculus
And still I stick with this
Im sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Your addicive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away from
Im addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
Im drawn to this, so I guess imma mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time imma
Aint changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abiss
You screaming as I walk out that ill be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop
Im leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And its just


Too late for the other side
Caught in a change
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a change
25 to life
Too late
Caught in a change
25 to life


Worst...


Mothafucka never loved us, fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now, still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions, nigga we don't know shit
Flexing! Nigga, I'm just flexing
Nigga never loved us, do it look like we stressing?
Look at you, look at you and look at you, aww, I'm glad that they chose us
Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish, just to see if I'm finished


On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us... Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up?
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior


Hold up, hold my phone, mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us, now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us, so everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up! You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B




Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothing changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm coming back on my worst behavior


Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior


Things been so crazy and hected
I should of have got back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better any how...


So if you gotta go
If there's anythin I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you looking for a purpose


You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm all singing karaoke, further than I ever been


So if you gotta go...
If there's anyway I can help


Isn't it ironic,
That the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
And tell's me my life is to much and moves to atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you would choose some where that had somebody that you know
I'm alway's up to late
I worry bout you there alone in a place you call your home warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy cause no man wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest but the first cut is the deepest
I tryed to keep us together you was busy keeping secrets
Secrets you would tell everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money
I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm suprise you couldn't tell


I was only trying to get ahead 
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And your looking for a purpose


I was only trying to get ahead 
But the spotlight makes you nervous...

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause


They loving the crew


Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'mma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know




Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
(If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city)
TRACK 4 ON TAKE CARE

"Morning, Marshall."
"Morning, doc."
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
"Anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. 
Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"
"Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back"
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."
"Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and 
it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, 
we know you're a busy person."
"But I thought variety was the most important thing?"
"So what else are you thinking?"
"Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, 
and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."
"Steps?"
"Yeah, steps."
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?
"Well, twelve."
"Christ, I don't even know them all."
"Really?"
"Anything else?"
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, 
what do I do if I find myself in a situation where 
maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I 
get tempted to?"
"Take a drink."
"What?"
"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."
"Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink 
I already know what that's gonna lead me to."
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
"Man, what the fuck!?"
"Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? 
Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. 
We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall...? Marshall!?
"No, no, no, no, NO!"

You know a lotta girls be...thinking my songs about them, but
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...


Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say you da fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate,
Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the matt and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

Cause,



Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffin theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 

Uhh, ah yea
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money
You know who you are, I got ya

 ()
This sh-t was all I knew,
you and me only,
and I did it all for you,
still you were lonely,
we coulda worked it out,

uhh, but i guess things change,
its funny how someone elses success brings pain,
when ya no longer involved that person has it all,
and you just stuck standing there,

But, Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,
Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,


Yeah,
ever since Ive been long gone,
I traded in my senorita for a microphone,
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see,
your life is good but me and you its catastrophe,
if I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied,
I need a paramedic girl, Im feeling paralysed,
if I could choose, you will always be a friend to me,
the more money I made you acting like my enemy,
its crazy, I cant help it if you feel ashamed,
lots of pressure will turn you into my diamond babe,
how can something so familiar be so strange,
closest friends get estranged when the status change,
ahh, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at,
and my whole wild is the only one that had my back,
you were the perfect girl, now it seems we dont match,
is it the money, want me to give it back,




Uhh, i am the topic of conversation, this a celebration,
lets toast to the fact that I moved out my momma basement,
to a condo downtown because its all about location,
I sit and drink wine and watch californication of life,
you shoulda been here to kick it with me,
we coulda split this whole thing up 50/50,
but now im at the 40/40 getting b-tches tipsy,
killing sh-t the ever so talented Mr Ripley,
how I go from being the man that you argue with,
to me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest sh-t,
I should wanna go back to the one I started with,
but Im addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit,
yeah, just ask me how things are coming along,
you can tell me that you never heard none of my songs,
long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen,
cos whats a star when its most important fan is missing?

and i fall in love with girls caught up with superficial glamour
who dress like sarah jessica
and live like princess diana
so often they have addictions
and im the one that'll feed it
but truely you're bad enough that you dont even really need it
you can show up at the party on dirty public transit
and i guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin candids
of you and your posse partying
drinking watch you get handed
with your virgin island tans
all lookin like you just landed
i dont really understand it

but these girls are having fun with whoevas money they spendin

Boomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm... (Louuuu)
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work a night shift

Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift

Young, but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Louuuu)

If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I'm never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me


Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)
My name is Shaaady
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)


You see that chick in the gym checking me out?
Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a (-I'll)? and I'm wrecklessly wrecking the house
That was suppose to be wreckless, where the heck is it now?
Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of your couch
Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'Open Sesame' mouth
Down the hatchet, the feeling, you can't match it
A rap-tap-tap on your door with the damn wratchet
A tat-tac-tac in the hall with the damn hatchet
A nap-sack-packed with like 40-some Zan-exs
Shorty come back, I'm tryin to score me some lapdances
I'm bout to relapse so maybe pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula 40-40 and 40s with mad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya


Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And are you menstruating baby, my lil friend's waiting to say Hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin like Jello
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello


My equilibrium is off, must me the Lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday extracurriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
51 people asleep in my damn living room
Scuse me hun? But what is your name, Liddy-young?
I want up next to ya naked and uh, did we umm?
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the fact that you, I'm cool, I immediately run like Speedy Gon-
Zalez to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum


Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And do you happen to have anything on you that make my mood mellow?
Some are open and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello


Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurtin me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)
I second that and a third, rush to emergency sur-
-gery to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purged
He's sees the loner getting the three-hundred bucks for these Perc-agains
Buster's getting to be where he lustfully surged it in
Pain it hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin him'
Childishly on the phone tryin to rustle up muscle relax-
-ants for his back and a couple of packs
Since now he's doubling back-wards and he stumblin back
Slipped and fell, hit his back-bone, heard something go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm bustin a rap
Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it, I'm back



And so I'm sayin...


Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)
My name is Shaaady
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen, you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soul mate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you

She said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

These days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

She says kiss you like miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
ANd when you're fuckinq someone else
just fuck her like she aint me

Damn those words are scary
those words are scary virqin mary 
I just tell her to spare me
I was in 

When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)


I know way too many people here right now that I didn’t know last year
who the fuck are y’all
I swear it feels like the last few nights we’ve been everywhere and back
but I just can’t remember it all
what am I doing, what am I doing
oh yeah that's right, I’m doing me, I’m doing me
I’m living life right now man
and this what I’m do til its over
til it’s over, it’s far from over


alright, bottles on me
long as I’m a drink it
never drop the ball, fuck y’all thinking
making sure the young money ship is never sinking
bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldn’t have drove, tell me how I’m getting home
you too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I’ve ever known
got to go thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
all I need is a fucking red jackets with some zippers
super good smiddoke a package of the swishas
I did it over night, it couldn’t happen any quicker
y’all know them, but fuck it me either
but point the biggest skeptic out I’ll make them a believer
it wouldn’t be the first time I’ve done it throwing hundreds
when I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ahh,




Uhhh,
one thing 'bout music when it hits you feel no pain
and I swear I got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
so they tell me that they love me I know better than that it’s just game
it’s just what comes with the flame
and I’m ready for that I’m just saying
but I really can’t complain, everything is kosher
two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
I really can’t see the end getting any closer
but I’ll probably still be the man when everything is over
so I’m riding through the city with my high beams on
can you see me can you see me get your visine on
y’all just do not fit the picture
turn your widespread on
if you thinking Imma quit before I die dream on
man they treat me like a legend
am I really this cold
I’m really too young to be felling this old
it’s about time you admit it who you kidding man
nobody’s ever done it like I did it
ahh
(chorus)

I got friends with money and i got money too
so we put it together
and let you pick what to do it and then we do that

Here I go. Im a rapper turned singer. And you can tell that he smoke, but I don't need my vocal cords all I hit is C-Notes.
N.E.R.D flow, i spaz if im prevoked
I'm about to change the fuckin game, pass the re-mote.
Money is everythang, and its every other thing.
I'm part of the choir, its the motto that my brotha sang.
Cash is the right now, women are the post game.
Money-over-bitches dot com check the domain.
It's comin too soon, album on the way.
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon.
Oops I mean a red moon... I did it again to 'em.
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation.
I say, heavy metaphors, flow so over weight.
I can rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake.
Frost bite drizzy nigga, no body as cold as Drake.
Keep yo ass in-line, don't be tryin to roller skate.
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit.
I am twenty-one tell me who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real cause I'm getting hood lovin I ain't even talkin' street shit.
Young angel, young lyin and I'm done tryin.
I'm just doin, who's drinkin cause I'm buyin.
It's on meee, everything is on meee.
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin john B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet.
This is for all the stripper cause I know that they gonna bump it tellem back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it.
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear.
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year.
Text brackets and back and forth faxes
My money comin full circle, get up on my axis.
Maybe Imma kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest.
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles and a booth.
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience cause I want it to make sense.

White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness. DRAKE!

Wayne: Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes. And they might even say you should leave me alone.
Homie scared. Cause they just like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy.
Just like Shaggy I toat dat boom bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck bout ya'll
I ain't talkin moths but you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm falling but up I fall and if ya bitch in heat she can fuck my dog.
I went from penny pinchin to private planes.
Never sat on any benches, I got in games.
Starter carter ball harder, ten girls penthouse suit ya'll order.
Whatever ya'll please. wine crackers and cheese.
They take off their clothes and put on my t's.
This supplement im on got me feeling mighty
My gun and money don't split call that shit Siamese.
My watch make the frickin' time freeze.
Yah girl bless me she suck my dick when I sneeze.
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need.
And eighteen G's is why the chicken cross the street.
Whatchya know about it my niggas so about it.
If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it.
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer.
Got the shoty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me.
Im a bad boy obviously, pop one at your ivy league
I dont have a rivalry if so you will have a casualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually.
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering.
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery.
You got short salary, and I got long money, I got cash money, I got young money. bitch...

Dj Drama: See I told ya'll it'd be well worth the wait right

Alls my life I has to fight, nigga 
Alls my life I... 
Hard times like God 
Bad trips like: "God!" 
Nazareth, I'm fucked up 
Homie you fucked up 
But if God got us we then gon' be alright 

 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
We gon' be alright 
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
Huh? We gon' be alright 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 

Uh, and when I wake up 
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut 
Behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down 
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down 
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life 
Painkillers only put me in the twilight 
What pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight 
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like 
Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy 
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow 
So my karma come and Heaven no preliminary hearing 
So my record and my motherfucking gang can stand in silence for the record 
Tell the world I know it's too late 
The hoes, the girls think I gone crazy 
Try and fight my vices all day 
Won't you please believe when I say 

When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga 
When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?" 
And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga 
I'm at the preacher's door 
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright 

What you want, a house or a car 
40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar 
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog 
Motherfucker you can live at the mall 
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know when it's illegal 
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero 
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal 
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you 
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you 
In the presence of your chico... ah! 
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool 
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you 
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog thats all 
Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all 
I rap, I'm black, on track and rest assured 
My rights, my wrongs are right till I'm right with God 

I keep my head up high 
I cross my heart and hope to die 
Lovin' me is complicated 
Too afraid, a lot of changes 
I'm alright and you're a favorite 
Dark nights in my prayers 

I remembered you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room 
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went runnin' for answers

yahh,

Lyrics © Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group




Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!


I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty range I heard that
She wanna go and party, She wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
'less I write it down for real, P.S


You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song


I really hope you play this
Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice, Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.S...




Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve
Every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking poor maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P.S.....




"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, you gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your Grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?"
"Enough with all this talkin"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you out that mother fucker homie" 

"Morning, Marshall."
"Morning, doc."
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
"Anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. 
Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"
"Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back"
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."
"Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and 
it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, 
we know you're a busy person."
"But I thought variety was the most important thing?"
"So what else are you thinking?"
"Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, 
and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."
"Steps?"
"Yeah, steps."
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?
"Well, twelve."
"Christ, I don't even know them all."
"Really?"
"Anything else?"
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, 
what do I do if I find myself in a situation where 
maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I 
get tempted to?"
"Take a drink."
"What?"
"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."
"Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink 
I already know what that's gonna lead me to."
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
"Man, what the fuck!?"
"Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? 
Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. 
We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall...? Marshall!?
"No, no, no, no, NO!"

ssss Shady aftermath
G-Unit! Haha

()
Cause we came here to set this party off right
let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in thru the front we'll come thru the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without a least sayin' good bye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right scream one last time.

Get your ass up for the Doctor
One more time Get your ass up for the Doctor
come on now, here we go
cliffhanger it's another club banger
got you hangin on the edge of your seat
get on down

Time's up, game's over, you lose i win
bout to show these knuckle heads how to do this here
oooh yeah, new year
next phase begin
look who's got you goin crazy again
i'm a trend, i set one every time i'm in
i go out and just come back in full circle again
if you a fad that means it's something that we already had
but once your gone you don't come back
too bad you're off the map now
radar can't even find you
we stay on the grind
you slip we out grind you
you walk around mad you let your anger blind you
we walk around just playin the violin behind you
enough with all the pissin and moanin, whinin and bitchin
sit observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
why i'm sittin multi-platinum, later 3 diamond worldwide
we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin

(chorus)

When Dr. Dre says "Crunk!"  you will get it crunk (get it crunk, crunk, crunk)
and when 50 Cent says "Jump!" you will get on one foot and jump! (jump, jump, jump)
Applause is tremendous , we drop you all the senses
i don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
we keep the party rockin off the hinges
we ain't showin off we're just goin off popular consensus
but critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all washed up
knock it off! Who the fuck is Doc impressin?
Doc is this, Doc is that
you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cockadock cause Doc left you all guessin
so DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?)
we gonna have this muthafucka hoppin in a second (uh huh)
that's why we always save the best cut last
to make the scratch and mix for it like fresh cut glass
We swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
spoke to an generation of angry teenagers whom if it wasn't for rap
to bridge the gap may be raised to be racists
who may have never got to see our faces
grace the cover of Rollin Stone pages
broke down barriers of language and races
just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
to pass the mic don't need ta play back and forth like 
the hot potato game or somethin

()

50 Cent come on!
Now snap, hands up
you know how we do, we make the club jump everywhere we go
it's no secret, everybody know 
when Dre's involved there's plenty of money involved 
and plenty honeys involved 
it's sunny Sundays and palm trees, Cali
every day is just another party from The Valleys
all the way to the "make my" alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the Grand Finale
now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
blaze a pound of weed 6 days about the week
you can catch me in the studio bangin out the beatsta
provide ya with the heat that keep blazin out the speakers 
so never say never cause Shady Aftermath together along with G-Unit 
records presents the return of the "The Doc" (O'Shay)
no one can do it better we tear that club up and leave without a shred of evidence
and a...

()

yeah! haha Still Aftermath 2006!
And don't worry bout that Detox Album... it's comin! 
We gonna make Dre do it. Ha ha! 
50 Cent  G-Unit

*
Yeah
I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time, like
What it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then, but
I can probably tell you a lil somethin' now


Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin', I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels and they silencin' you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here
I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch chrome green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years
It's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap
It's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' dranks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like (vocalizes)
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring 07
Second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is whack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at the dinner table and say "my baby's famous and I knew it"
Find More lyrics at www.sweetslyrics.com
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I'm drawin' and drawin' till the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out


Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF


Closer to my dreams (Miss Andreena Mill)
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah (Yeah man)
I feel it in my sleep (Sing it to 'em baby)
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams


Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progress
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video has made everything right with ex (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Too many rappers and not enough-
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
They can't
Play pen drop out
The gray ten drop out
Summer 05 with the gray Benz drop out
Charcoal charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the awful dodger
Showed her I'mma
I told her I'mma
Bout to get my run-on so hold the commas
Times changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home



Closer to my dreams 
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah 
I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks

Hi! My name is.. (what?) My name is.. (who?)
My name is..  Slim Shady
Hi! My name is.. (huh?) My name is.. (what?)
My name is..  Slim Shady

Ahem.. excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?


Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Ummmm..)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh! "So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!




My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Owwwwwwww!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians
In a space ship while they screaming at me: "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans (Aaahhhhhh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!'




Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive (Huh yup!)
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? (WAH!)
YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS! (WAHHH!)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (BANG!)
I'm steaming mad (Arrrggghhh!)
And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had



Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit ain’t my fault, girl cause I'm lonely

Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody’s house that you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it, I’m not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae

This shit ain’t my fault

Loving you is complicated 

I place blame when you steal 
Place shame when you steal 
Feel like you ain't shit 
Feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself 
Breakin' on marble floors 
Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours 
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special 
What can I blame him for 
Nigga I can name several 
Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin' 
A baby inside, just a teenager where's your antennas 
Whats your intentions where is the influence you speak of 
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her 
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure you ain't no leader 
I never liked you, forever despise you I don't need you 
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you 
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, thats for dedication 
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent 
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it 

Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof 
I can feel you vibin', recognize that your ashamed of me 
Yes I hate you too 

House keeping 
 
House keeping 
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto! 
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto¡ 
!Disculpe! 

Are you the reason why mama and them leavin' 
No you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it 
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it 
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it 
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out 
You was deserted, where was your antennas again? 
Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend? 
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend 
A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend 
Little brother, you promised you’d watch him before they shot him 
Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches 
You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven 
You even faced time instead of a hospital visit 
You should thought he would recover, well 
The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real 
Then he died, God himself will say "you fuckin' failed" 
You ain't try 

I know your secrets nigga 
Mood swings is frequent nigga 
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga 
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin' nigga 
Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and your the reason nigga 
And if this bottle could talk *gulp* I cry myself to sleep 
Bitch everything is your fault 
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend 
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed 
I know your secrets 
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin' 
And that time you *gulp* I'm bout to hurl 
I'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you 
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof 
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago 
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago 
And if those mirrors could talk it would say "you gotta go" 
And if I told your secrets 
The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated
against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,
give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the
evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but
they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...



I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm
cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I
never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me
inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a
multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father
must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,
no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I
couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it
work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm
man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest
shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot
Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...



Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you
think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'
your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'
through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of
Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew
up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made
that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your
gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna
know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but
you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't
admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare
you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in
hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess
what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
I faced her around
But his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His bridges, he out grow'd em


Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand,
Someone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm, you prick
You call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder
You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me
See he's in a whole nother weight class
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets
You're full of it; you were just in his CD's
Left at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E

I'm haunted I'm dead your gone

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oooooh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it 

{verse 1}
all niqht i've, been starin'
can you tell i want you ?
can't be too, wide open
but there's nothin, i won't do
ohhh... just want  you to know

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

{verse 2}
I wish i... wasn't famous
I wish i... was still in school
So that i can have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you crazy

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious


{fadey fade away.... lls .}

The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either crip or piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and,.. real talk, and


This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, y'know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hold up
Where you from? "How-bang"
Where you stay? "Westside", that's a piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed to cross Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the hot ninety-five, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but


This is why they fuck with me (I told you nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, y'know?


This is why they fuck with me 
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

So there you have it
But I'm a leave you with this
An OG once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I'm gone

I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock


She got the good good
She Michael Jackson bad
Im attracted to her
For her attractive ass
And now we murders
Because we kill time
I knock her lights out
And she still shine
I hate to see her go
But I love to watch her leave
But I keep her runnin back and forth
Like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day
Hot as a summers eve
Young money thieves
Steal your heart with ease


I like the way you walkin
If your walkin my way
Im that red bull
Now lets fly away
Lets buy a place
With all kinds of space
Ill let you be the judge
And Im the case
Im Gudda Gudda
I put her under
I see me with her
No Stevie wonder
She dont even wonder
Cuz she know she bad
And I got her n*gger
Grocery bag

[Young Lloyd)
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me Mr. Flinestone
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock


Okay I get it
Let me think
I guess its my turn
Maybe its time to put this p*ssy on your sideburns
He say Im bad

He pressin me like buttons downs on a Friday night
Im so pretty like
We on my pedal bike
He on my low skirt
He on my edgar whites
He say Nicki dont stop

and I just be coming off the top as bestest


I Love ya tosha roll
Hotter than wasabi
I race for your love
Shake and bake
Ricky Bobby
Im at the W
But I cant meet you in the lobby
Girl I gotta watch my back
Cuz Im not just anybody
I seen them stand in line
Just to get beside her
I let her see the aston
And let the rest surprise her
Thats when we disappear
You need GPS to find her
Oh that was your girl?
I thought I recognized her


Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me Mr. Flinestone
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock


She like tanning
I like staying in
She like romancing
I like rollin with friends
She said Im caged in
I think her conscience is
she watching that oxygen
Im watching ESPN
But when that show ends
She all over my skin
Lotion
Slow emotions
Roller coastin
Like back and forth
Hold it
She pose like its for posters
And I poke like Im suppose to
Take this photo if you for me
she said dont you ever show this
Im to loyal and to focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this she rejoiced this
She said your words gets me open
So I closed it where your clothes
Im only lovin for the moment


She aint got a man
But she not alone
Miss. Independent
Yeah she got her own
Hey gorgeous
Um, I mean flawless
Well, thats what your are
How I see it is how I call it
Look at how she walk
Mhm she know she bad
Do your thing baby
I aint even mad
And I aint even fast
Imma stay a while
Hold your head Chris
Imma take her down
(Young Lloyd)
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left.
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Nights over goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's dumb enough out there I blind fold her,
She still comes back to my crib, Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But i wont buy her a soda Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of fritos I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would i buy you a gay ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Man TIP told me on this hoe tip
Best tip I could give you to hip you
Never let these traits trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, shit
Dig you a hole
Take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, its you, but fuck it TIP, it's cool
I'm chillin like a Villain
Like the penguin in it's fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
before I tie a fucking knot I'd tie you in one bitch
you think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger although a nickle might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
there's a bombshell, scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was some motherfucking stud
Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way fo shizzle
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slot checks stob bizzle
So fuck scissors these checkers are bust like a blood blister


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP
And each one thinks "Say this shit"
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, put a sticky note to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gonna tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote 

Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
Some shit about a message you left 
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" 
This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! 
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre 
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way) 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch 

So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
We can fly over the border "Let's go" 
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
 (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri 
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste 
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Plus he raps with his regular voice 
 (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys 
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ 
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! 
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
Do somethin'! At least one punchline 
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs 
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither 
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!) 
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', ain't no tellin'

Suitcase, I been livin' out a suitcase
Still drinkin' Henny, if it's done, I'll take the D'usse
Oops, aye, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
True say, I been goin' hard, but then again
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in, man
I got a blunt, can I get a light?
Yeah, I took the summer off to get it right
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Niggas like "you took the summer off? we couldn't tell"
Dawg, just bought a island, gotta sail to it
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it somebody gotta do it
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it

Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
The shit was gettin' too predictable
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah
I mean we hear about the money you been gettin'
We just never seen a visual
It's our year (aw yeah), Aw yeah
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)
What's the word these days?
Buncha' niggas chasing after all these woman they don't even know (WOOO)
Buncha' out of season woman
Fuckin' off-season niggas to get last season wardrobe (WOOO)
All the rappers that you vouch for
Need to get out of the house more, they washed up
And even if the team was religious with it
I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, naw (WOOO)

OVO, Unruly
One shot to make it in a life
From the six to the fucking 876

I gotta keep watchin' for oppers 'case anything's possible, yeah
There's no code or ethics out here, anyone will take shots at you, yeah
Niggas think they can come take what I got, let's be logical, yeah
V-Live, I order that Alfredo pasta then eat in the kitchen like i'm in the mafia
Houston, they get me though
European, my vehicle
How much it hit me fo'?
Ain't no tellin', yeah
What am I willin' to give her to get what I want tonight?
Ain't no tellin'
Please don't speak to me like I'm that Drake from four years ago
I'm at a higher place
Thinkin' they lions and tigers and bears, I go huntin'
Put heads on my fire place, oh my
Take time, ain't no tellin'
Oh my, ain't no tellin'

 Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

 Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see


Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right 
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
We elevated to new heights premeditated 
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate 
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance 
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop 
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know


So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

 Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see


So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack 


So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become

I got a bone to pick 
I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again 
(Aye aye nigga whats happenin' nigga, K Dot back in the hood nigga) 
I'm mad (He mad), but I ain't stressin' 
True friends, one question 

Bitch where you when I was walkin'? 
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta 
Black man taking no losses 
Bitch where you when I was walkin'? 
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him 

When you got the yams (What's the yams?) 
The yam is the power that be 
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street 
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can) 
I can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer 
What the fuck happened? 
(Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell 
But most of you share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell 
(A two man cell) 
Something's in the water (Something's in the water) 
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller 

When you got the yams (What's the yams?) 
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor 
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires 
24/7, 365 days times two 
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage 
Just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say... 

You goat mouth mammy fucker 
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves 
Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help 
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail 
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left 
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton" 
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest 
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too 
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' woo woo 
Ah yeah fuck the judge 
I made it past 25 and there I was 
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him 
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina 
Screamin' "Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok?" 
Limo tinted with the gold plates 
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast 
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfucking king 

(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk) 
We want the funk 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
(Do you want the funk?) 
We want the funk 
(Do you want the funk?) 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence

Attention all units, attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
He could be coming at your girlfriend next


There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him unmercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone


Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


I’m going through changes
I’m going through changes


Lately I really, feel like I’m rolling for like Philly,
I feel like I’m losing control of myself,
I sincerely apologize if all that I sound like, is I’m complaining,
But life keeps on complicating, an’ I’m debating,
On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls,
Can see I’m grievin’, I try and hide it,
But I can’t, why do I act like I’m all high and mighty,
When inside, I’m dying, I am finally realizing I need help.
I can’t do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I’ve been having ups and downs,
Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying,
Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here.
I’m hatin’ my reflection, I walk around the house tryin’ to fight mirrors,
I can’t stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie,
I’m afraid if I close my eyes I might see her,
Shit…




I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin’ at noon,
Yeah dad’s in a bad mood, he’s always snappin’ at you.
Marshall what happened at you, you can’t stop with these pills,
And you’ve fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughin’ at you.
It become a problem you’re too pussy to tackle, get up,
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled.
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed,
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust,
Nah, it ain’t like Doody to do that,
He wouldn’t fuckin’ shoot at, no-body, he fights first,
But dwellin’ on it only makes the night worse,
Now I’m poppin Vic’s, perks and Methadone pills.
Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it,
Fuckin’ drug dealers hang around me like “yes man”,
And they gon’ do whatever I says when, I says it,
It’s in their best interest to protect their investment.
And I just lost my fuckin’ best friend, so fuck it, I guess then…



Don’t know what I’m gonna do,
but I just keep on going through changes


My friends can’t understand this new me,
That’s understandable man, but think how bananas you’d be,
You’d be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.
And everybody’s lookin’ at you, what you want me to do,
I’m startin’ to live like a recluse and the truth is,
Fame startin’ to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low.
I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin’ the same damn DVD,
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive.
And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin’ pills’ll make me feel alright.
And if I’m still awake in the middle of the night,
I just take a couple more, yeah you’re motherfuckin’ right,
I ain’t slowin’ down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, dole em out,
Daddy, don’t you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground.
Fuck, don’t I know the sound of that voice,
Yeah baby hold me down.




Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow I’m pullin’ through.
Swear when I come back I’ma be bulletproof.
I’ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few,
Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth.
Shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?
I think about the things I would never got to say to you,
I’d never get to make it right, so here’s what I came to do.
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too,
I still love your mother, that’ll never change,
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together.
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it,
But I swear on everything, I’d do anything for her on anyday.
There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains,
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn’t any pain.
But I can’t pretend there ain’t, I ain’t placin’ any blame,
I ain’t pointin’ fingers, heaven knows I never been a saint.
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history,
But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say,
I miss you self consciously, wish it didn’t end this way.
But I just had to get away, don’t know why,
I don’t know what else to say, I guess I’m…



Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach

I'm in Miami
I need to call up Miss Cassidy
My name is party, not participation
Sorry for the miscommunication
I need a drink and some tequila with you
You know what I'm trying to do
Hey, let's pop the E off at Liv
I've got some time here to blow
I've got the money to blow
I've got the money and blow
Don't have to guess how I know
Oh, it's a secret just for me, I'll keep it
You old niggas boring as bones
You put the PARTY tape on
You know what's going on
You know what's going on
She keep it wet like tsunami
She think she sunk the Titanic
I get her hot like Wasabi
She think it's wavy and gnarly
I think I'mma pop one for you
Drink one for you

Still in Miami
Most of these girls are too messy
I've got to do some reflecting
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction
I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like brrrrr
I'm on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type
I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight
PND ain't with the ray tay, you know Jay Wray
Got girls here going way way way way way way
Sauga city trip the pay day
Glo'd up off a gate way, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in their feelings these days
All in their feelings these days
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes
You should be afraid

I'm preaching, oooh
Preaching
Preaching, babe
Preaching, whooo
I'm a finally, finally
Yeah

You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ooww Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you’ve all been waiting for ..
In this corner : weighing 175 pounds,

Slim Shady!

 : Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don’t act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh Uh-oh, bitch3s hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where’s the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I notice there’s so many of them
and there’s really not that many of us.
And ladies love us, my posse’s kicking up dust.
It’s on till the break of dawn
and we’re starting this party from dusk

Ok … let’s go

Eminem
Back wit Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you’ll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the fumunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
Its a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed.
Bitch3s lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us. Its ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the sh-t
gets worse then worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
Its elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say we're the center of attention its true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here’s the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio’s back on you hoes.

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don’t act like a snobby model.
You just hit the lotto.
Uh-oh Uh-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I notice there’s so many of them
and there’s really not that many of us.
And ladies love us, my posses kicking up dust.
Its on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

Dr Dre
They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain’t got to tell me why you’re sick cuz I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.
I’m an itch that they cant scratch, they sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cuz over and above all, its just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I’ll be dammed, just f*cked around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end
Lets cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know.
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision.
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

50 Cent
It’s bottle after bottle
The money ain’t a thang when you party with me

We ball out of control like you wouldn’t believe
I’m the napalm the bomb the don i’m King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I’m so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the shaun dawn burn marajauan do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man i’m caking you know i don’t give a f*ck
I spend it like it don’t mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherf*cker i’m grown
I stunt i style i flash the sh-t
I gets what the f*ck i want so what I trick
Fat ass burgundy bags classy sh-t Jimmy Cho shoes
I say move a bitch move

{verse 1}
all niqht i've, been starin'
can you tell i want you ?
can't be too, wide open
but there's nothin, i won't do
ohhh... just want  you to know

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

{verse 2}
I wish i... wasn't famous
I wish i... was still in school
So that i can have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you crazy

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious


{fadey fade away.... lls .}

Cause sometimes you feel tired, Feel weak
And when you feel weak
You feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
You gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that sh*t out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And be a quitter
No matter how bad you just wanna fall flat on your face

Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps as long as you feel 'em
To the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
Your coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a f*ck.


Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this sh*t till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out
I'ma rip this sh*t till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when your real
and you spit and people are feeling your sh*t.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much sh*t as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end.
Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this sh*t that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outcast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the sh*t does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people got a f*cking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you’ve got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.



Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
what is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And its absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.



Until the roof
The roof comes off
Until my legs
give out from underneath me

I will not fall,
I will stand tall,
Feels like no one could beat me.


Yesterday when we were getting high
you were invited, you woulda liked it
uh uh ah, I know you all too well
we said that we can kiss the past goodbye
but your weren't excited
there's no way to fight it
you can stay shawty but here I go


Should I spend the weekend in Vegas
I'm busy living the moment not taking pictures to save it
I mean how could I forget
my memories never faded I can't relate to these haters
my enemies never made it
I am... still here with who I started with
the game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr sh-t
carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship
yeah, I'm 23 with a money tree
growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist and thats how she met my pops
and now my garden is enormous, it's happening penny lane
I said its happening Penny Lane
just like you said I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead
uh ahh, thats word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough!


What am I afraid of
this is what dreams are supposed to made of
the people I don't have time to hang with
always look at me and say the same sh-t

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh



Am I wrong for making light of my situation
clap on when 40 got something for me to snap on
NOw that I'm on I dont want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on
get my f-cking buffett on
I heard they jsut moved my grandmother to a nursing home
and I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
but hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
that I barely know at all and
plus this women that I mess with unprotected txt us saying she wish she woulda kept it
the one I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
I couldn't tell you where the f-ck head is
I'm holding on by a thread its like I'm high right now
the guy right now and you can tell by looking at my eyes right now
that nothing really comes as a surprise right now
cause we having the time of our lives right now




I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
the other day Lissa told me she missed the old me
which made me question when I went missing
and when I start treating my friends different
maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the 2 guns in my face during the stick up
maybe cause I girl I f-cking trusted set the whole sh-t up
but a fact I have'nt seen 'em since they locked big Rich up
I know, the same time, I'm quick to forget
bout to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets
burn it al burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
cause half the itme I got it right I probably guessed
did I just trade free time for camera time
will I blow all of this money baby, hammertime
yeah, I just need some closure, aint no turning back for me
I'm in it till it's over

How much a dollar really cost? 
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts 
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, y'all 
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car 
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo 
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 
20 years ago, can't forget 
Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals 
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do 
20 on 6, he didn't hear me 
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu 
My American tongue was slurry 
Walked out the gas station 
A homeless man with a silly tan complexion 
Asked me for ten grand 
Stressin' about dry land 
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open 
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' 
He begged and pleaded 
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it 
Told him, "Beat it" 
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it 

Listen to me, I want a single bill from you 
Nothin' less, nothin' more 
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door 
Tell me how much a dollar cost 

It's more to feed your mind 
Water, sun and love, the one you love 
All you need, the air you breathe 

He's starin' at me in disbelief 
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key 
He's starin' at me, I started my car and tried to leave 
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see 
A reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him 
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor 
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser 
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious 
Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect 
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck 
I never understood someone beggin' for goods 
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could 
And this particular person just had it down pat 
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked 
Have you ever opened to Exodus 14? 
A humble man is all that we ever need 
Tell me how much a dollar cost 

Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment 
I never met a transient that demanded attention 
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' 
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different 
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless 
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? 
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies 
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time 
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin' 
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise 
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine 
Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin 
Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin' 
Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal 
Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up 
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus 
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy 
You looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet" 
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep" 
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free 
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power 
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve 
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost 
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God" 

I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me? 
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be 
Shades of grey will never change if I condone 
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs



It's Young Money Baby
I got something for these niggas to ride to

Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love,
Cause I don't have the time for that
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where it's at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract

I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggaz for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch

And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

Baby, I ain't have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight, sex tonight

Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100 nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

Whole squad on that real shit

Whole squad on that real shit

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'

Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

 Hailie

 Come here baby
Bring daddy his Oscar
 Okay

I'm about to get rid of some hoes it's simple
I put the Murder Inc with lead and I'm not talking about a pencil
Look at what the fuck you dun got into
I see you found your nitch you're just a bitch with a menstral
Claiming you a murderer and spelt it wrong
You put the "E" before the "D" because that's all you on
You on Pac's dick (bitch) you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins 3 deals that another nigga got you they didn't see
skills
And I ain't playing your a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be praying on his cover cause he need it
And you niggas hating shut your mouths
It's just the real niggas ain't buying that shit you put out


Doe Rae Me but we don't sing motherfuckers
So Murder Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team who expects nothing less then R 'n' B coming from that regime
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream
Now that you embrace the green don't fuck with the triple beams
You're a motherfucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen?
Artists with repituares saw him in action, Pac's assassination
Def jam grabbed him, told him reenact him you'll go platinum
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins
Reenacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in Detroit motherfucker

Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac

To grievance and the crying and intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga you shook,
You're half of a half-way crook nigga get off X dick go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one and when your gone you'll only be the late fake
one
Nigga please stick the script before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch, fucking old ass ignorant innocent looking senior citizen
Built up slap you like renaissance sicitive wait a minute hold on
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch made man now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holla and curse and go ahead and respond
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse


Slim set an impulse to get at the wanktas
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the drama for stucky and bush stones
What's wrong? didn't think were strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
This real witness you all ain't caught the concept
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source
Threatening at the boss you're gonna see me on your porch
Now I've got the nerve to try serve on us
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust


Do I gotta get my nigga bugs, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Caddillac, Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat
You not Pac's songs without laws will help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your "mock"avelli get your own identity


Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da

Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them benjamin's go cuddle up 
Skip, hop, trip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock 
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this" 
Thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix

El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers 
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you 
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you 

Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked 
The little homies called, they said, "The enemies done cliqued up" 
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio? 
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio 
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous 
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras 
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin' 
Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer 
The streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town 
From Compton to Congress, it’s set trippin’ all around 
Ain’t nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans 
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’? 
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs 
Make it they promise to fuck with you 
No condom they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?" 

Everybody want to talk about who this and who that 
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black 
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’ 
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum 
Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit 
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since 
Don’t ask about no camera back at award shows 
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my foes 
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it 
I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button 
Had the Coast on standby 
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box” 
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide 
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets 
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats 
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay 
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game" 

I remember you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence 
Sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screaming in a hotel room 
I didn't want to self-destruct 
The evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went running for answers 
Until I came home 
But that didn't stop survivors guilt 
Going back and forth 
Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned 
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
But while my loved ones was fighting 
A continuous war back in the city 
I was entering a new one

I want you to understand something
that when I come up in this b-tch I want the fans jumping,
I want the fist pumping in the air,
I dont look like a millionnaire,
but I feel like a million bucks,
ladies wont ya fill your cups,
Shadys come to fill ya up,
if your a D or a C cup
you can even be a B
its just me and DRE
youll be in the ER well be strapped with so much TNT,
we may blow no not even CPR from the EMT
could help you to resuscitate
you busters must be flustered wait
you cant cut the mustard, whats your problem cant you bust a grape,
whats my name, shady came and just crushed the game,
its really not even fair to them,
cos they pale in comparisons
so much they might aswell wear a skin,
dont you just wish you could share his pen
cos this sh-ts getting embarrassing,
the fog is stinking the air is thin,
cos he wont even let them try to breathe,
da da di di da di dee, he makes it look so easy,
girl you just hit the lottery,


now this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on,
and hell breaks loose,
try to restrain us you cant contain us,
we still gonna make a statement no matter what we do,
everywhere we go it seems were looking for any excuse to just cut loose,
so this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose,


This is when sh-ts hits the fan,
like it just splattered on stan
this is the only moment that matters,
ya homie rolled in with Mathers,
like chaos erupts Ems in back Dres in the front
so do what we say at once this songs like a singer it hunts (?),


It makes em stay in a trance
no choice they have to dance,


Its like the play-off just making sure that we stay in the hunt
take a day off of what man you better lay off the blunts
you must be smoking something
you think I aint smoking nothing stay off my nuts,
now hit the floor baby time to wipe away all the rust,
shake all them cobwebs loose,
loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose,
yeah girl shake that caboose
I dont wanna see you try to make no excuse,
DRE is on the loose,
A Mongoose when its comes to the chronic use,
you know I cant stand to lose,
me and my goons are like animals,
we come through like a pack of wolves,
so we came here to retract the roof,
yeah man aint that the truth,
girl your mans like in the booth
definitely back up in this b-tch,
this is when all hell breaks loose,




Now I know your feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words,
A murderer in the flow, liquid courage im finna blow
as soon as we hit the door power surges head to toe
Im sure to push it as far as words are meant to go,
were in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows,
ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block widcha hoe,
with speakers knocking its 3 0 clock
me and Doc then proceed to drop (?)
and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door,


Yeah so let us in fore we huff and puff and we blow,
we aint bluffin for nothing
well knock the stuffing out ya
revenge is so sweet, move til ya injure ya feet
yeah move or lose it three,
move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably,
pass some of that (?) lil right there,
that would be pretty stupid to me,
born and raised in the CPT,
yeah Los Angeles whos in the streets,
them haters hating on me,
but I refuse to lose any sleep,
keep that deuce deuce in the seat,
Dre fall off thats news to me,





Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great then I falls, my insides crawl
and I clam up (wham) I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road


I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road


I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, and the same pants
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road




You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't the skillest
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each on of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

Naah man haha

Cinderella Man (x4)

Who can catch lighting in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin out the nozzle on a fire hose, cry it and swallow

Cinderella Man (x4)

Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, takes his hands and cup em
Spin around to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff em

Cinderella Man (x4)


There's a storm comin that the weatherman couldn't predict
I've start to ball prick you better flea cuz I get ticked
it's a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch ya to the ground ya trick
It's a trap, fuck my last CD that shit's in my trash
I'll be God damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in a blink of an eye, so betcha I'll last
So keep winkin and blowin kisses cuz ur flirtin with death
I'm destroyin ur livelihood, I ain't just hurtin ur rep
I catch a flow and get goin,
No remorse, I'm showin they slowin, for no one, knowin there is nothing you can do about it
Zeroin in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I'll shut your lane down, if you can spot the parked in at 2
Arsenic flower, lighter fluid, saliva, what can you do
lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com
Go get ur crew, hype you up, stand behind you like "woooooooo"
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how bout you?
Now guess who....(Hey)
Here's a clue....(Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
Now, what's his name

Cinderella Man (x4)


If I had a time machine
I'd be...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Music is my time machine
So call me...

Cinderella Man (x4)


Fuck catchin lighting, he struck it
Screamed shut up at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward

Cinderella Man (x4)

Rewound the future to the present
Paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker he's the shit right now
he's...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Cinderella man sent to fell Shady dey
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell from hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with this Cinderella story,
nor did he come to do the same, or can't afford to be a lamo in this day and age
And at this stage in the game, mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old H-I to the new Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah
The coupe de gras, raise em high, in the sky
People are tryin to bring this place alive
Thanks for bein patient I will make no more mistakes,
shit my Potatoes baked homie the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin weed, yea faggot the stakes are high
Shit I ain't even supposed to be here by the grace of God
By the skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts I skated by
Now ya'll are on in ice with ankle weights I hate to lie
Now how fuckin irritated are you, how much in ur face am I
And there ain't shit you can do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and I'm a spittin image I mirror it
When I stand near it, ur pussy lyric I couldn't hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
Who? (Hey)
Here's a clue (Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater and lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
now...what's his name




I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous a**
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your a**
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that s*** you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.)
Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Drawin' a Blank like
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.

Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma do that for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()

Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
Imeet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

Fuck dat
8 doobies to the face
Fuck dat
12 bottles in the case
Nigga, fuck dat
2 pills and a half, wait
Nigga, fuck dat
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist


Man, I swear
My nigga trippin off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him vicodin
Hope to take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of section 8
And you feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are
A loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins
Make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin off
My generation sippin cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition
That the world is bout to end
Who gives a fuck? we never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
A melody and some hoes
Playstation and some drank
Technology bumping Soul
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd, that's product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black
She black too
Purple label on her back
But that dap
Is like when she take it straight to the head
Then she look at me
She got AD-HD




Like woah oh oh woah (x4)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(They always told me ad-hd did it)


And then she started
And then she started
Feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
Beg you pardon
Oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23
Ok then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said where my drink at?
I'mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors
Have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds
Closed the screen, jumbotron
Made it to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it
Then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That ADHD crazy






You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six
Just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, dro, hoes
Whatever you like
You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light

This is why I do this shit.

I think they call this, uhm, venting.

 1:

Look
Uhh.

This is me.
Still the same.
They want the hits.
I play the game.
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.
It all comes spilling out like i hit a vein.
Watt up lil Braw.
Watt up slum Ville.
I hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still.
The fans thinking that we all signed for one meal.
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.
That aint how it works.
That aint that how it goes.
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.
And I could use a writer to balance out my flows.
But I never share my thoughts,
This is all a nigga knows.
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised.
And I would be performing just as long as Im alive.
So every word I utter will be mine.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
Oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

 2:
I never cried when Pac died.
But I probably will when Hov does.
And if my tears hold value, then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us.
And Ill be standing in a puddle.
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.
And ima keep it honest.
Am so tired of being subtle.
Its just me, Forty, O, and nich standing in a huddle.
Staring at the members of my team.
Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme.
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.
I hope you tell your family this shit aint what it seems.
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.
And know I pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions.
At least I put it all in the open.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

 3:
Look.
Fuck all yall.
We ignore feelin's here.
Premature millionaires.
Welcome to my realest year.
Yeah.
I swear we making a killah here.
I should be on top of the world here just chillen here.
Uh.
But its funny having fans.
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance, and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit dont feel the same.
Yeah.
And plus things are just so real at home
People think Ive changed just because my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere so im never actually am alone, i just always feel alone.
I think im scared of what the future holds.
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.
Every girl I meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes.
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
All my old friends think i got a new crowd.
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.
I guess that mean they come few and far between.
Even though am living out what you would call adream.
Yeah.
And my uncle aint even messaging me.
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.
I hope this isnt one of those forever things.
Its funny how money can change everything.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.


I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25 sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?


One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt?
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

 

Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your motherfucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?, cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6

 1:
Aiyyo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, cause they be actin maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming pills or roaches, we sprayed and disinfects
and twist the necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass in a track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
I'm Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

 2:
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, some fruit to stomp,and then two feet to rinse
I greet intensive ladies, I spoil all your fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the only one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My a capella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

 3:
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility 
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tractical, tactful, track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
I'm Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite(x2)

Drake-Over-Thank me later
(uhh,

1:

Makin sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin
Bout to set it off, set it off in this Bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldnt've drove, tell me how Im gettin home?
You too fine to be layin down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I needs a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the swishers
I did it overnight, it couldnt happen any quicker
Yall know them? Well, fuck it, me either
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make'em a believer
It wouldnt be the first time I done it, throwin hundreds
When I should be throwin ones, bitch, I run it (Ah)

One thing bout music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, its just game
Its just what comes with the fame, and Im ready for that, Im just sayin
But I really cant complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinking Ima quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
Im really too young to be feelin this old
Its about time you admit it, who you kiddin, man?
Man, nobodys never done it like I did it (Ugh)

I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last year, who the fuck are yall?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just cant remember it all

What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh, yeah, thats right, Im doing me

:Katsthatskate

When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hoping that you’ll survive
Gather your wind, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

When I get signed, homie I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue eyed devil with a fat ass monkey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game, made a bad bitch yours
When I get signed homie I'mma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican, run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated but I got a million dollar check, like that

We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home

Yo what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keeping it, motherfucker

What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam on your dollar
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliche and say, fuck your haters
I can see the borrow in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies with a snow white collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me feel forever baby, count it all together baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
Too much and enough both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick
And when you get the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

Lookin' down is quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top you got it)
A lot of metaphors, leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'



I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly,
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home (home)

I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly,
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it (oh yeah)
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

So just hold on we're going home (going home)
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on we're going home (going home, going home)

You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Oh just hold on we're going home (going home)
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on we're going home (going home, going home)
Hold on 




We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!


Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here


Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth
Cuz the people that hurt can’t understand it
You speakin outlandish, I’m ashamed how to make it all work
Another planet, it’s a short term role for me
I rec it’s all for me, it’s just mo with me
And you’re here for you too here can re-persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin off, I ain’t takin off these pistons
I’m takin off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much it’d cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a shortterm goal, no sky is the limit
I’m past that, now pass that
A word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours


I see myself performing at
Soldout shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammys, winning 5 awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Can’t imagine how it feels
That’s why I’m smiling every day
Cause my dream ain’t far away


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


You’re looking at me and tell me I’m blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I’m at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, I’m reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I’m a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow I’mma take that I’ll never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I root
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin to you, I was walkin it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello


And I’m so happy I cry
Cause I can’t believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it’s so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you play so hard
And you’ve come so far
And you go, that is the time for you to leave your more
And I’m gonna do it
Watch me


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better

You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you're the f-cking coldest
Intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

Well aren't you a breath of fresh air
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they aint got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking somes d-cks until some millions appear
Voila! you do it right he might just buy you a car
Unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre
Independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer
Make it rain finger (check)
M3 beamer (check)
Champagne range
Triple white Caddy
Closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and BeBe
Ya don't need it greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who f-ck for bowls of baked ziti

And my NY girls let me see your hands
Wave em at the b-tches hating on you with their friends

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Showtime
Go, go, go, go, go, go
As we proceed.


Uh, 5 and a half in boys
Ass is off the hook
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never
But never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever
You just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas
And enough money to loan us a little something extra
Should we ever need it
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it

Need y'all niggas to feel me yo,
Feel my pain...
Said soft niggas can't last hard times yo,
Believe that shit.
Real niggas don't cry...
Look,
Yo...

Was just a youngin' with that fresh fade,
Bird chest, legs skinny,
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny,
Fresh pennies on my feet,
Momma paid for everything I'm wearing,
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world.
Aw. nigga, but shit done changed since "Mayne" was my nickname,
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game,
Now I'm a man worried about my fam'
Let me explain,
Its like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shits sprained.
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle,
Feeling like the world's on your back so you stumble,
And it feels like a quarterback get sacked, and then you fumble.
Jobs don't call a nigga back so it's back to the hustle.
Niggas praying for they moms,
At the same time they moms pray for them.
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way,
But damn a nigga been a lost fate.
It hurts on the usual,
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral.

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.

I sit back and watch the news every now and then,
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash,
Even the weathers bad.
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted,
Like damn it's '06 and niggas still up on that gang shit?
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split
Only seventeen, he was finna graduate in like three weeks,
some stupid niggas got him for his chain,
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped,
Some dude snatched her and she was standing at the bus stop, wait,
man she just eleven!
What the fuck is up with this world,
got these grown niggas fucking with girls?
Plus the cops harassing us,
every week be blasting us, on accident, or so they claim
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain
They killed her only son,
Make her wanna blow her brains out,
Change the channel man I can't watch this shit...

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.

Take a ride through the city man and tell me what you witness.
Poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits,
violence, hatred, real devastation,
neighborhoods looking like there's still segregation,
welfare, single mothers, no jobs,
tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie,
fiegns in the street so high off of that crack shit,
this nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress...
White folks got the road to success mapped and that's all good,
but why don't black's got that same atlas?
I asked the same question a million ways
and it seems like I had prayed for a million days.
Still the ills remain - just bills and pain.
Shoot outs and project buildings, children slain,
skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why.
Its enough to make a nigga wanna cry,
but I can't though...

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.

We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same

Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that noila got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?

Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been?
You deserve rounds tonight, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight

She says kiss you like miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
ANd when you're fuckinq someone else
just fuck her like she aint me

Damn those words are scary
those words are scary virqin mary 
I just tell her to spare me
I was in 

Intro]
 I wanna hit line drives...
 Wanna lose weight and keep eating...
 For you...
 Hey, whats up doc?


 Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
 You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
 To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth
 I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
 The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
 Looked in the mirror, then realized I-I-I had something to prove
 You told me "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
 Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the road


 And I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), and I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
 And I run it, (Yeah! Blow!), and I run it, (Yeah! Blow!)
 That's ironic, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
 That's ironic, (Y-Yeah! Blow!), I run it, (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)
 Salt all in my wounds
 Hear my tears all in my tunes
 Let my life loose in this booth
 Just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused
 And I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), and I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
 And I run it, (Y-Yeah! Blow!), and I run it (Yeah! Blow!) That's ironic


 Liberation...leader...
 Popular pie plant pictured here...
 Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote!


 This shit make a nigga just wanna write
 Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
 Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
 Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
 I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
 Tell a story that I'll never glory 25
 Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
 And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
 Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
 Nobody gon' abide by your rule
 Nobody holding your gun, how come your tongue say killa then kill my mood
 Light speed living in the world you know
 Little old me, feeling like a live wire
 Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
 Til' I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
 I am from the bottom of the jungle
 Living in the bottom of the food chain
 When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
 A new name, want stripes, and you and zebra look alike
 Hope another homicide don't numb you and none do
 Things we will never learn soon
 In the era where we wanna earn soon
 That's a error, you can smell it in the air and everybody really doomed
 That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
 All y'all can suck my dick
 All them days at the county building
 Now I'm 'bout to make my mama rich
 Cartoons and (cereal!) I ain't felt this good since
 Scrooge McDuck, (here we go!) Elementary hood shit




 This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
 Even with a pot to piss in
 I'mma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
 Dismiss any business of yours
 Discounts never did amount to a check
 That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
 Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
 AKs for the whole hood
 House lick went down perfect
 Two shots to the head he deserved it
 I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
 Dark Wing Duck lost service
 Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
 Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
 I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
 This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
 Emerging on everbody corner (dash for it)
 Get a toe tag when you play tag with a task of a new (task force)
 Everybody wanna know my life
 How did I make it (past yours)
 Well let me tell you like this
 I've been running this shit since (I asked for it)
 Cartoons and cereal




 Salt all in my wounds
 Hear my tears all in my tunes
 Let my life loose in this booth just for you
 Mufucka hope y'all amused!
 I did wrong, karma came
 Crackers gave me ball and chain
 Friends, enemies all the same
 State, fed, both can hang
 Nobody can mute me, but I never said nobody can't shoot me
 Just another stat to the white folks
 Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
 Everyday feel like the one before
 Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
 If you do what you always done
 Then you get what you always got
 You dumb buffoons!
 I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
 For about the past 72 hours
 Hand on my heart, face to the hood
 I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
 Yeah this me, no mic
 No cameras, no lights, just pain
 Mama how much trauma can I sustain?
 Dirty money come with lots of stains
 Road to riches come with lots of lanes
 Just another player with lots of game
 Never had shit, got lots to gain...

Just another player with lots of game
 Never had shit, got lots to gain



I was born with a dick in my brain
Yea fucked in the head
My step-father said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
"Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?"
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said, 
"I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid"
The bastard won't even eat nothing he scared
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead
Debby don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there stick a fucking cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's faking it
I bet you, I'll bet he prolly wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course unless you object
Ah, go fuck his brains out if any is left in his head



If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane



You get it? No I just tried to bite my face off
I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw bit the fucking blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop
Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like king kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he layed all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants he took every fucking thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yea, maniac that Shady dog
Man that motherfuckers gangsta, ain't he dog?
Shady dog, what be going through that fucking brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waiting for? Sing along.




Don't you know what felch means? (Yea)
Well then tell me, would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp belch and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying man? can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my step-father felt me
Fuck a little puppet kick the puppy while he's yelping
Shady what the fuck you saying? I don't know help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fucking melting!
Marshall I just love you boy I care about your well-being
No dad I said no, I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy I can do it by myself see
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it Pubic Hair on Chelsey
Well this is called Ass-Rape and we're shooting the Jail scene






I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I...
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real 


I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself




I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they mow that's green
I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you love me
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and their present is old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?




The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word "but", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real


"... I ain't trippin' off that Dominos anymore, just calling, sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did homie". "Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga". "Realness is responsibility, realness is taking care of your motherfucking family, realness is god, nigga"




"Alright that's all I wanted to tell you, just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom."

"Boy you better have my jawn on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't tripping. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by the food for less, and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take this music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago you know that's what we do."


Sing my song, it's all for you 


"If I don't hear from you, by tomorrow... I hope you come back, and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back, with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? talk to you later, bye."

all I got to do is point to the spot,
when the bomb drops boy does it drop,
and when it does boy there’s a problem,




Boy dont jinx yourself,

Stringer bell boy, my name rings bells for itself,
I’m sick as hell boy,

Bringin hell boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
and to that boy who done said it …,

Im bout to turn this f-cking place to Beirut in a day
so hey wouldn’t you say Im the sh-t,

Intro:
Where's my snare
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you eva been hated, or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin', and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigga me, but they'll neva figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probley sick of me now
Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ha!

I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Imma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a coupla months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side,
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work
Wit her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I grew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't't't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, MA!
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, MA!
But guess what, ya gettin' olda now and it's cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your FUNERAL
See whets hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yaself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get,
You selfish bitch
I hope you fuckin' burn in in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Let's get it, I can't wait to trick man
It's gonna be so sweet
Summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine

Still like, "Can you hit it with your OVO goose on?"
I'm like, "What are you on?"
Told me that she two on, ha, that's cute we a few on
I could show you what to do in this bitch
Take the addy with the water pop two and then sip
Me, you and your bitch
And we talkin' bout life, love too and this dick
First I had her in the six, then we had her in the six
You know I got another bar for ya
I'mma chill baby, we don't want the devil in this bitch, nah
Got a bad one we could call it Kelly Rowland
Oh she get the jelly rollin', Akinyele in the telly
Cause she open I could tell that she from Oakland
Pasadena, what up?

I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2

A nigga got a woosah, comin' at me never work no matter who try
I got 'em all a cheque without the woo-hah
Flip modes on ya quick got a few sides
Comin' from the 6 side
Where niggas goin' shower posse just to get by
Stay true never switch sides, yea, the game turn me into this guy
Yea, and now every time Drake out
Cameras always flashing tryna put me on the Takeout
Crib in Calabasas man I call that shit the safe house
Thirty minutes from L.A. the shit is way out
But these days that's where I'm stayin'
You can hear it in my voice I'm goin' way in
Yea, OB that my brother like a Wayans
Just know I only show up if you payin', nigga
Yea, I always been on, I always been too on
For like the past five years all these niggas wanna shine
I got the flashlight here man
Bout to hit the gas right here man
Old soul livin' in the past life here man
You, bring the cash right here man
Miracle, sit your ass right here man
Man, You know I hate to wait
That's why I get it first and you get it late
Yea, OVO sound that man that's everyday
It's Young Money Records get the record straight

I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2 on
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2

You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so bad girl, you're so awful
I fuck you right in my office
You go tell your friends you're honest
That's why all your friends are on
You know you made me a promise
We're not in this for commitment
Your man's gone and you don't miss him
Book you flights and confirmation
Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasing that paper
Even though you're exhausted you're still gonna make it girl
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so, you're so
You love to get 2 on

And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know that I put you on
And you know, that's something yo

That's what they doin', Cameron, they actin' like these singers, man.
I ain't goin' to the studio until I got a situation.
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer.
Who gonna be on the hook?
Man, what is you doin'?
Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!

Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though
Voice mail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, "nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, "the first mill gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work

Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)

Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man

Hear What?
Yo hear what, tek time
(Laughing)
Ahh, no shit!
Yo hear what?
Wa gwan ...
Yo him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van you know Drizzy

Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing

I do better with the rider in my system
Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we

Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker. Boys playin' Playstation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?

Yeah, sound sound sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this?
How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions
We ain't doing no interview

Yeah, yeah, oh, you gotta love it
Oh, you got, oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried
It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual, my career's like a "how to "manual
So I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we have words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to R.I.P. about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But man, oh, you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it


Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?


Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There is vomit on his sweater already
Moms spaggehti he's nervous
But on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over BLOW!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that
But he's broke, he's so sad that he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home
That's when it's back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody, better go capture this moment
And hope it don't collapse on him


You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better


Soul's escapin' through this hole's that is gaping
This world is mines for the taking
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring
But superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads got him
He knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold ya nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold prada
They moved on to the next shmo who flows
Who nose dove and sold nada
And so the so proper
His toll, it unfolds and I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on
Duh duh doe, duh doe, dah dah dah dah




No more games, I'ma change for due called rage
Tear this muthafuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped writin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Pfifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's gettin' even harder tryin' to feed and water
My seed plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a pre-madonna
Baby momma drama, screamin' on her
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotony 
Has gotten me to the point
I'm like a snail, I've got to formulate a plot
Or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only muthafuckin' option, failure's not
Momma love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot
Feet fail me not
Cause maybe the only opportunity that I got




Duh doo
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

CHORUS (1x):


END!!!


Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you


I'm just so fucking depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump,
but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up, 
in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided to just pick this pen
Up to try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, 
I need a new outlet
And I know some shits so hard to swallow, 
but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you got to walk a thousand miles


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humour
Everything's so tense and gloom, I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room
Just as soon as I walk in, It's like all eyes on me, 
so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that it then it opens the door for conversation, 
like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, 
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, 
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack, and half of them ain't even funny,
like "AAHHHHH!
Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn!"
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell, hell
We don't gotta trade our shoes, and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves, and flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could of either just sat on my ass, and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in, and get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never 
did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me, keep making that face til it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there holding my tounge, 
tryna talk like BLEGH!
Then I stuck my tounge on that frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson then, 
'cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story, not just based off my description
Cause where you see it form where you're sitting, 
is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a miles in eachothers shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you

Yeah, to my babies, stay strong, dad will be home soon
And to the rest of the world... God gave you them shoes, to fit you
So put them on and wear them... be yourself man, 
be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny... 
don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful

Here I go. Im a rapper turned singer. And you can tell that he smoke, but I don't need my vocal cords all I hit is C-Notes.
N.E.R.D flow, i spaz if im prevoked
I'm about to change the fuckin game, pass the re-mote.
Money is everythang, and its every other thing.
I'm part of the choir, its the motto that my brotha sang.
Cash is the right now, women are the post game.
Money-over-bitches dot com check the domain.
It's comin too soon, album on the way.
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon.
Oops I mean a red moon... I did it again to 'em.
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation.
I say, heavy metaphors, flow so over weight.
I can rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake.
Frost bite drizzy nigga, no body as cold as Drake.
Keep yo ass in-line, don't be tryin to roller skate.
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit.
I am twenty-one tell me who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real cause I'm getting hood lovin I ain't even talkin' street shit.
Young angel, young lyin and I'm done tryin.
I'm just doin, who's drinkin cause I'm buyin.
It's on meee, everything is on meee.
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin john B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet.
This is for all the stripper cause I know that they gonna bump it tellem back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it.
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear.
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year.
Text brackets and back and forth faxes
My money comin full circle, get up on my axis.
Maybe Imma kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest.
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles and a booth.
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience cause I want it to make sense.

White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness. DRAKE!

Wayne: Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes. And they might even say you should leave me alone.
Homie scared. Cause they just like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy.
Just like Shaggy I toat dat boom bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck bout ya'll
I ain't talkin moths but you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm falling but up I fall and if ya bitch in heat she can fuck my dog.
I went from penny pinchin to private planes.
Never sat on any benches, I got in games.
Starter carter ball harder, ten girls penthouse suit ya'll order.
Whatever ya'll please. wine crackers and cheese.
They take off their clothes and put on my t's.
This supplement im on got me feeling mighty
My gun and money don't split call that shit Siamese.
My watch make the frickin' time freeze.
Yah girl bless me she suck my dick when I sneeze.
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need.
And eighteen G's is why the chicken cross the street.
Whatchya know about it my niggas so about it.
If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it.
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer.
Got the shoty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me.
Im a bad boy obviously, pop one at your ivy league
I dont have a rivalry if so you will have a casualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually.
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering.
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery.
You got short salary, and I got long money, I got cash money, I got young money. bitch...

Dj Drama: See I told ya'll it'd be well worth the wait right

Hello
Yeah I just walked in
Yeah I'm good you still working?
Tonight, right now?
'Did I go out' yeah I went out
I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed
Shit... wine or water
You said something about a cold drink
I don't know, I'm delirious... night


Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy

But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
"F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing thats so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say

F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin' 'bout bitches
That we almost had
I don't think I'm concious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeh we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeh, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women thats living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on


Well I'm sorry" -- Drake
Are you drunk right now? -- Woman

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me


You're not going to come?
Guess i'm bout to just kick it here then...

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Drizzy,
Oh yeah Trey I fucking feel you,
They be staring at the money like it's unfamiliar,
I get it,
I live it,
To me there's nothings realer,
Just enough to solve your problems,
Too much would kill ya,
And when I leave,
I always come right back here,
The young spit it and everybody in rap fear,
A lot of ya'll still sounding like last year,
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier,
Nickels for my thoughts,
Dimes in my bed,
Quarters of the kush,
Ain't the limes in my head,
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD,
Yeah,
I want it all,
That's why I strive for it,
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it,
I know what's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,

I just wanna be,

Yeah,
I want things to go my way,
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,
And my mother tried to runaway from home,
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway,
And she cried to me so I cried too,
And my stomach was soaking wet,
She only 5'2,
And 48 hours all before I showed up,
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
Damn my reality just set in,
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
I do a lot of things,
Hoping I never have to fit in,
So trying to keep up with my programs is like a dead end,
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
And life change for us every single week,
So what's good,
But I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Wise words from a decent man,
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand,
This lost boy got fly without peter pan,
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,
In person I am everything and more,
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,
Just call me shop and bag drizzy,
And call me Mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy,
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad,
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
To big homie use a flash if you must,
And I swear I ain't asking for much
All I want is


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

It's like I know what I got to say,
I just don't know how to say it to you


Pardon the swag,
But bitches cartate,
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,
How come I can't,
Miss a woman like I can't miss cartdates,
Cheese,
But shes not in this portrait,
Life's fine but I don not portray,
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
I don't want the glow,
I want the glow ray,
And I'm a fuck the world,
But this is just foreplay,
Tired of hearing bullshit,
Bring her on to cowshit,
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than ? shit,
That's word to toronto,
So high up I got birds in the condo,
Ain't that a female dog,
Ask her who I am to her,
And she yell god,
Weezy baby go ? hard,
No further details boy.

Drake] 
I am on a 24 hour champagne diet

Damn 
Where my roof just go 
Im somebody that you should know 
Get to shakin somethin cus thats what Drumma produced it for 
Yes i make mistakes that i dont ever make excuses for

Im losing my thoughts i say damn 
Where my roof just go?

All over your skin 
Got money to blow oh oh oh oh

We certified gettin it CM YM Cash Money business 
Higher than the ceiling fly like a bird, hit the gucci store 
And later get served 
We smoked out with no roof on it 
Them people passin so we smash on them 
Ballin out we keep the cash on deck 
Lamborghini and the Bentleys on the V-set 
Louie lens iced out with the black diamonds 
Car of the year Ferrari the new Spider

Born rich born uptown born to win 
Fully loaded automatic 6 Benz 
Candy paint foreign lights with my b-tch in 
Born hustlin too big n-gga to strive me up

And Im with two women make you take a second look 
We poppin like Champagne Bottles But We Never Shook 
and We Goin Be Alright If We Put Drake On Every Hook

What's wrong nigga? 
I thought you was keeping it gangsta? 
I thought this what you wanted? 
They say if you scared go to church 
But remember 
He knows the bible too 

My baby when I get you get you get you get you 
Ima go head to ride with you 
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you 
Cause I (want you) 
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty 
Registration is out of service 
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving 
Cause I (want you) 
I want you more than you know 

I remember you took me to the mall last week baby 
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times 
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified 
That I (want you) 
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy 
I said you crazy 
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you) 

You said to me 
You said your name was Lucy 
I said where's Ricardo? 
I said oh no, not the show 
Than you spit a little rap to me like this 
When I turned 26 I was like oh shit 
You said this to me 
I remember what you said too you said 
My name is Lucy Kendrick 
You introduced me Kendrick 
Usually I don’t do this 
But I see you and me Kendrick 
Lucy Give you no worries 
Lucy got million stories 
About these rappers I came after when they was boring 
Lucy gone fill your pockets 
Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton 
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised 
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty 
Avoiding me? 
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly 
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute 
Lucy work harder 
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father 
I'm Lucy 
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly 
Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me 
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front 
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work 
I want you to know that Lucy got you 
All your life I watched you 
And now you all grown up then sign this contract if that’s possible 

I remembered you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room 
I didn't wanna self destruct 
The evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went runnin' for answers 
Until I came home

Uh,
I'm just so far gone, 
October's own, 
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong,
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown,
parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne

You know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A
Pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
You know, so... forgive me
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

Uh,
And life is so insane, 
Look what I've became, 
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why yo girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain

Me, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man.


Yeah, uh-huh


Uh, hardly home but always reppin,
You hardly on and always second,
When I'm awake you always restin,
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question,
I, I'm doin classic shit in all my sessions,
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin,
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions,
I just always did my own thing,
Now I run the game, you stupid muddasuckas
I see all this money through my ohio state buck eyes,
Shippin goin good, but good can turn to better,
Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
come on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
come on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Yeah, wrong way down the one way,
Women don't get saved round me even on a sunday,
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who,
Then they meet my pop and tell 'I'm ''Drake is just a younger you'',
And shawty wanna party so don't let yo girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ, of me givin her mouth-to-mouth,
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her,
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcom X an Martin Luther
I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady,
They just loose to love, those are tennis games lady,
Have you countin money goin dufflebag-crazy,
Sippin on Pink Floyd an puffin Wayne Brady,
Damn, who's line is it anyways,
I'm in the daze, you been amazed, y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage,
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze,
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right,
You look nice, and yo frame, makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well alright, guess I might, know what fuck it yes I will,
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin less than real
Put it to you right


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
come on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest,
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused,
The gangstas recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's,
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus,
Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this ibomb, I palm
The game like it's a spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great mike,
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this gon be a great night,
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white,
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,
This that major moment you've been waitin on for too long,
The best that ever did it an doin it on a new song,
UGK an Young Money too strong
Down in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


I am the leather jacket, black glasses, all american bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket an you, you just a bag boy
Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you neva had boy
Hate an I will leave ya chest the color of my flag boy
Super bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
An I keep that toaster you can come an be my strudel biiiitch
I'm so uptown, an mothafucker if you aint don't go uptown,
yeah
And now I'm on that rock-shit
But why they let me in I'm a start shootin at a mosh pit, haha
Fuck is you talkin bout, weezy in ya mouth now
Weezy whatchu talkin bout......Yung Mulaah Baaby


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on




(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
> Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will serve you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?


(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right


(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right
Aw Yeah

(Intro) 

Yeah, can't stop now... 
This maybe the last chance I get, to be famous 

(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 1) 

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist, they call me Slim Rothelsberger 
I get beserker than a fed up post office worker 
A murker with a mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered 
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter 
For a gangsta, you should of shit your pants when you saw 
The chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel 
I faced her around when his fangs come out, get your brains blown out 
That's what I call blowing your mind, when I come back like nut on your spine 
I'm a thumbtac that you slept on son 
Now here I come screaming "attack" like I just stepped on one! 
Lowering the totem til' he showed 'em, defiance, giant scrotum 
He don't owe them bitches shit, his bridges, he out wrote 'em 
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the south pole and 
Nobody fucks with him, rigamortis and post-mortem 
He's dying of boredom, take your best rhymes, record 'em 
Then try to thwart him, he'll take your punchlines and snort 'em 
Shit stained drawers, you gon' fuck with the guy that licks the blades of his chainsaws 
While he dips 'em in P.F. chang's sauce 
Game's off homie, hang it up like some crank calls 
You think I'm backing down, you must be out your dang skulls! 
I'm almost famous 


(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 2) 

I'm back for revenge, I lost the battle, that ain't happening again 
I'm at your throat like strep, I step strapped with a pen 
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are distorting my mem-ory 
Some are wrote on a napkin, do what I have to to win 
Pulling out all stops, any who touch a mic prior 
Is not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers 
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the whacko 'for 
I take a shit in his jackolantern then smash it on his porch 
Now get off my dick, dick's too short of a word for my dick 
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism you prick! 
Don't call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer 
I just blew up the challenger, matter of fact, I need a lawyer 
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast 
Beat his ass naked and pee'd in his corner like Verne Troyer 
Ya'll are Eminem backwards, you're menime's 
See he's in a-whole-nother weight class, his slugs your BB's 
Your bean bag bullets, you're full of it, you were dissing his CD's 
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheeties 
No peace treaty's, he's turned into a beast 
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the might DRE 
He's almost famous 

(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 3) 

Now there he goes, in Dre's studio, cupping his balls 
Screaming the wood off the panelling, cussing the paint off the walls 
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads 
He ain't giving 'em shit, he's scissor pinch a penny so hard 
He'll leave a bruise on the brawn so dark 
You can see the mark when it scars, til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out "AHHH!" 
His metaphors and similies ain't similar to them not at all 
If they don't like they can all get fucked, instead of sucking him off 
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by 
Like David Carridy, they can go fuck themselves and just die 
And eat shit while they at it, he's fucking had it 
He's mad at the whole world, so go to hell and build a snowman, girl 
The bullies become bullied, the pussies get pushed 
They better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me 
Cause I ain't looking back only forward, this whole spot blowing 
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it 
And while I'm being poetic, let me get a stork 
And raise the bar higher than my opinion of these women ? 
So bare witness to some biblical shit 
As the cold wind blowing, this world ain't gonna know what hit it, he did it, he made it, he's finally famous!

How much a dollar really cost? 
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts 
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, y'all 
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car 
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo 
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 
20 years ago, can't forget 
Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals 
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do 
20 on 6, he didn't hear me 
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu 
My American tongue was slurry 
Walked out the gas station 
A homeless man with a silly tan complexion 
Asked me for ten grand 
Stressin' about dry land 
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open 
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' 
He begged and pleaded 
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it 
Told him, "Beat it" 
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it 

Listen to me, I want a single bill from you 
Nothin' less, nothin' more 
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door 
Tell me how much a dollar cost 

It's more to feed your mind 
Water, sun and love, the one you love 
All you need, the air you breathe 

He's starin' at me in disbelief 
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key 
He's starin' at me, I started my car and tried to leave 
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see 
A reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him 
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor 
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser 
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious 
Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect 
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck 
I never understood someone beggin' for goods 
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could 
And this particular person just had it down pat 
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked 
Have you ever opened to Exodus 14? 
A humble man is all that we ever need 
Tell me how much a dollar cost 

Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment 
I never met a transient that demanded attention 
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' 
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different 
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless 
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? 
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies 
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time 
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin' 
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise 
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine 
Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin 
Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin' 
Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal 
Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up 
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus 
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy 
You looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet" 
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep" 
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free 
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power 
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve 
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost 
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God" 

I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me? 
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be 
Shades of grey will never change if I condone 
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs

This is why I do this shit.

I think they call this, uhm, venting.

 1:

Look
Uhh.

This is me.
Still the same.
They want the hits.
I play the game.
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.
It all comes spilling out like i hit a vein.
Watt up lil Braw.
Watt up slum Ville.
I hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still.
The fans thinking that we all signed for one meal.
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.
That aint how it works.
That aint that how it goes.
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.
And I could use a writer to balance out my flows.
But I never share my thoughts,
This is all a nigga knows.
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised.
And I would be performing just as long as Im alive.
So every word I utter will be mine.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
Oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

 2:
I never cried when Pac died.
But I probably will when Hov does.
And if my tears hold value, then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us.
And Ill be standing in a puddle.
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.
And ima keep it honest.
Am so tired of being subtle.
Its just me, Forty, O, and nich standing in a huddle.
Staring at the members of my team.
Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme.
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.
I hope you tell your family this shit aint what it seems.
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.
And know I pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions.
At least I put it all in the open.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

 3:
Look.
Fuck all yall.
We ignore feelin's here.
Premature millionaires.
Welcome to my realest year.
Yeah.
I swear we making a killah here.
I should be on top of the world here just chillen here.
Uh.
But its funny having fans.
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance, and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit dont feel the same.
Yeah.
And plus things are just so real at home
People think Ive changed just because my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere so im never actually am alone, i just always feel alone.
I think im scared of what the future holds.
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.
Every girl I meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes.
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
All my old friends think i got a new crowd.
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.
I guess that mean they come few and far between.
Even though am living out what you would call adream.
Yeah.
And my uncle aint even messaging me.
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.
I hope this isnt one of those forever things.
Its funny how money can change everything.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant I'ma be a better you
Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville
For Phil, Listen even back when we was broke my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory
I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches bitches so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark skinned and Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out of touch with reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
Fuck em' then we kick em' to the door
Nigga you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave
I'ma need my shirt back
Nigga you know how it go

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably in Tennessee that says fool me once, shame on - shame on you.
If you fool me we can't get fooled again

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved


This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havn’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our seperate ways
So i’m single...
Thinking about what we had and missing you
But I aint santa, I got something for these bad b*tches too
I mean paprazzi on me trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthaf*ckin heart out, its drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me do I ever cross your mind
Because all this sh*t is new to me, i’m learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good
I know that n*ggas would kill for this lifestyle

Never forgettin from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed

You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me

(I'm doin my thing 3x)

The closest your gon get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The names young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’m gon need a thug wife

Now my insides looking like a snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers

(?) so whats the deali young done everything in the A but f*ck chillin
So welcome to my life no two days the same
Like for yall to meet the love of my life her names the game


I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down

You'll think of me

I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit at home, I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid I'mma die before I get where I'm going
I know I'mma be alone
I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road
I just gotta know the road

Something is said, don't say that again

{just pull the plug!}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
(repeat all 2x)


Hand me an 8
Beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world {i'm here}
And shit on brandy and mase
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill {ahhh}
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot
And people goin' feel me cuz i'ma still be
The mad rapper whether i got money or not {yup}
As long as i'm on pills, and i got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin' makin' fun of your yacht
But i would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in the source
And a wardrobe i can afford
Otherwise i might get sent up back-strike in a ford
And you wonder what the fuck i need more vicadive
Everybody's pissin' me off; even a no limit tank looks like
A middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit i'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would i kill you and jump in a grave and bury myself

{just pull the plug!}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin' to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
{just let it go!}
(repeat all 2x)


I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than rosco beating james tar senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {ouch ouch}
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that i used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, i kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that i failed 9th grade
You probably think that i'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, i just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
As i fall down a cement flight of steps (ahhhh)
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

{just let it go}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin' to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
{just pull the plug!}
(repeat all 2x)


My basic disk will make you take a razor into your wrist
Make you satanistic
Make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains
Are rippin' out your skull so bad
And sew you back and be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "role model," i don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and hailey jade is shady's business
And shady's just an alias i made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when gil was payin me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You may be gettin' a bigger attitude than maybe kim's got
And the shit's almost got the same fate that grady's bitch got
I know that "just the two of us" would make you hate me this much
And just the two of us
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life
It's just words on a mic.
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a show business pig
But the funny shit is that i still go with the bitch

{just let it go}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin' to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
{just pull the plug!}
(repeat all 2x)

That's the shit I'm talking about though
Like you changed up
You don't even fucking link nobody no more
You just dash me away like a cyattie
Yo, you cheesed me dog

Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it’s dark out 
To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss ya
Shit’ll come back around and get ya
Crazy like all my niggas
Crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the BAR exam
I drove in the snow for you
You probably don’t remember half the shit a nigga did for you

Ya, you ain’t really fuck with me way back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
How bout now?
Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?

Always been daddy’s little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain’t even say thank you
I had no money
Left from back when I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like “who’s this?”
I be like “me, girl.”
You be like “oh word, true shit?”
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel I have it like that
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I’m not even Christian I still went to church that year
Guess, I just had to pretend that year
I ain’t even see my friends that year
Places that I should’ve been

You ain’t really fuck with me way back then
But how bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
How bout now?
Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?

Why do I feel so alone? 
Like everybody passing through the studio ,
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role ,
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know,
And I don't have the heart to give these, 
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go, 
So they stick around kicking out feedback, 
And I entertain it as if I need that, 
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that,
My privacy about the only thing I need back but, 
It's hard to think of them polite flows, 
Mr. Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes, 
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes, 
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed, 
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows, 
Life was so full, 
Now this shit just being lipo'd, 
Always said I'd say it all on the right track, 
But in this game you only lose when you fight back, 
Black diamond bracelets, 
Showing you the basics, 
I can't live and hold the camera, 
Someone gotta tape this, 
I make hits unlike a bitch, 
That's married I ain't miss, 
24 hours from greatness, 
I'm that close, 
Don't ever forget the moment, 
You began to doubt, 
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out, 
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South, 
Watchin' whole show, 
Embarrassed to pull my camera out, 
And my mother embarrassed, 
To pull my Phantom out, 
So I park about 5 houses down, 
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown, 
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around, 
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus, 
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness, 
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus, 
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless, 
And promoters try to get me out to they club, 
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how, 
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, 
Standing with my next girl, 
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now, 
And shit could get weird unless they all down, 
And so I stay clear.

We from a small town, 
Everybody talks and everybody listen, 
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing, 
I've always been something that these labels can't buy, 
Especially if they tryin' to take a peice of my sou,l 
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez "Damn Drake fly" 
And he just be like "Silly mother fucker I know" 
That was your bad, 
How could you pass up on 'em? 
He just take them records, 
And he gas up on 'em, 
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em, 
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em, 
Oh they did Po, 
At least they tried to, 
And that's what happens, 
When you spitting what's inside you, 
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video, 
And they think they can market you, 
However they decide to nahh, 
But Forty told me to do me, 
And don't listen to anybody that knew me, 
'Cause to have known me would, 
Mean that there's a new me, 
And if you think I changed in the slightest, 
Could of fooled me, 
Boy in my city I'm da 2-3, 
Drug dealers live vicariously through me, 
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy, 
I'm just not the social type, 

And campus life is crazy understand, 
I could get money with my eyes closed, 
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo, 
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll, 
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know, 
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will, 
I got new shit, 

I'm gettin' better still, 
Little niggas put my name in they verses, 
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal, 
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill, 
And I think this got this "Making of a Legend" feel, 
Problem with these other niggas they, 
Ain't never real, 
Yea ... that's all I can say.

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone till November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house takin' no calls
I done hit the stride, got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the wri-wri-wri-wri




Cloud nine, Kendrick Lamar, uh
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I started questioning God, what is my purpose?
He say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up man, I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again


What am I gonna do? Gotta have faith
Life is too much, understood? Where is your faith?
Oh, faaaaaaaith...
All you need is the size of a mustard seed


Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't bout shit, that nigga ain't bout shit
Spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature
and maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice
that said the Devil is a lie, make a better choice
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
with them crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her section 8
Then lost her faith again




Kendrick, I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
This about how faith works, yeah, murk it...
I had dreams of holding a nine-milla to raise Killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas ensue
The rat's lurking, vulture's circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
to make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach cloud nine, that's what my niggas bout
But it never rain in California 'less them pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Ray Charles voice




This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering is there really a God?
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
But whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
and wonder why I ain't never caught that feeling before
Maybe they know him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know is that he's real and he lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because he's testing your faith again

I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
than die and find out there really is, think about it 

All aboard, okay, next stop, my basement… ha ha
I'll meet you down there

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Haters getting mad, they done had enough of shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touche me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's a no-no who even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I ought to just be honest but

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert, and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad, when I call them both faggots
It's all these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the weiner schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
Body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him
Homie, I'm the sheisse, pass Doctor Dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussys queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A even got a bidet
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator 



It's not me and you
It's not me it's you
Your reckless and you know it
They don't love you like I do
Say you're moving over, like guess that's just the motion

I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

I don't have a fuck to give
I been moving state to state
In my leather and my Tims
Like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chubb
That's my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
That's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling
'Cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone

But, I guess that's just the motion
And your phone doesn't ring when they got everything
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

Yeah,
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
'Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her
And she know it
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help

But, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh) 

(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.)
Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Drawin' a Blank like
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.

Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma do that for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()

Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
Imeet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

()

I grew up, a fuckin' screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need somethin' newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I won't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I, could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
Cause I'm tryna stay alive,
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet tryna dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? Aye who am I? (Yeah)

Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better dawg I can't lie
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to sooth your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

I always did shit the hard way, my niggas *** slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was broadway, Times Square
Kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chubacca
Whispers that he got it for the low low
Sell a, dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain, took her whip
The appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front door
His mama at home, she still let em' hit the blunt though
I told her hello and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash, and just asked
"What a nigga gotta do to get that? Put me on"
He just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga you know how you sound right now?
You won't my mans, I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me, when I look up to you
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't never want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show ol' girl what she missing
The illest nigga alive
Aye who am I?

Things change, rearrange and so do I (Aye who am I?)
It ain't always for the better dawg I can't lie (Aye who am I?)
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to sooth your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

I never felt better

(uhh, Young Money, Yea)

:
I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last year, who the f**k are yall?

Makin sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin
Bout to set it off, set it off in this B**ch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldntve drove, tell me how Im gettin home
You too fine to be layin down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing Ive ever known
Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these n***as
All I needs a f**king red jacket with some zippers
Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers
I did it overnight, it couldnt happen any quicker
Yall know them? Well, f**k it, me either
But point the biggest skeptic out, Ill make him a believer
It wouldnt be the first time I done it, throwin hundreds
When I should be throwin ones, b**ch, I run it (Ah)

But its far from over

2
One thing bout music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that sh*t that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, its just game
Its just what comes with the fame, and Im ready for that, Im just sayin
But I really cant complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin Ima quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
Im really too young to be feelin this old
Its about time you admit it, who you kiddin, man?
Man, nobodys never done it like I did it (Ugh)

:

No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining

Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated
against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,
give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the
evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but
they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...



I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm
cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I
never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me
inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a
multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father
must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,
no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I
couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it
work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm
man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest
shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot
Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...



Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you
think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'
your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'
through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of
Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew
up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made
that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your
gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna
know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but
you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't
admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare
you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in
hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess
what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...

*
Yeah
I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time, like
What it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then, but
I can probably tell you a lil somethin' now


Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin', I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels and they silencin' you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here
I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch chrome green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years
It's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap
It's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' dranks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like (vocalizes)
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring 07
Second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is whack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at the dinner table and say "my baby's famous and I knew it"

And it wasn't nothin' to it
I'm drawin' and drawin' till the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out


Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF


Closer to my dreams (Miss Andreena Mill)
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah (Yeah man)
I feel it in my sleep (Sing it to 'em baby)
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams


Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progress
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video has made everything right with ex (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Too many rappers and not enough-
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
They can't
Play pen drop out
The gray ten drop out
Summer 05 with the gray Benz drop out
Charcoal charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the awful dodger
Showed her I'mma
I told her I'mma
Bout to get my run-on so hold the commas
Times changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home



Closer to my dreams 
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah 
I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
Some shit about a message you left 
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" 
This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! 
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre 
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way) 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch 

So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
We can fly over the border "Let's go" 
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
 (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri 
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste 
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Plus he raps with his regular voice 
 (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys 
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ 
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! 
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
Do somethin'! At least one punchline 
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs 
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither 
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!) 
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Intro] 
Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging 

 
I'm withholding my anger 
Though I'd like to be the strangler 
Of this punkass little pussy's puny neck 
It's my right to insist 
That he acknowledge my existence 
But he just displays complete lack of respect 
That's what he says to himself 
As he uses magazines to trash me 
As he sits with both feet up at his desk 
Smokes a bag of his weed 
And starts imagining things 
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed 
And in his jealousy and envy 
It just whirls him in a frenzy 
As he turns on MTV and sees my face 
He don't exist in this world 
So he just twists and he twirls 
Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a race 
And it's destroying him slowly 
Cuz he does not even know me 
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes 
So he just tortures himself 
He has no fortune and wealth 
So he extorts someone else to get his dough 
And now he's acting like a bully 
So he tries to push and pull me 
But he knows that he can't pull me so he's mad 
He has no choice but to scream 
And raise his voice up at me 
Cuz it annoys him to see that I ain't scared 

 
You aint no motherfucking (bully) 
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking (bully) 
I won't allow it, aint no coward to no (bully) 
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully) 
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...) 

And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...) 

 
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies 
No more unfortunately 
There's so many motherfuckers that just are 
They just keep pounding at me 
Now that I'm down with 50 
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja  
But his ass is such a puppet 
Irv could stick his whole hand up it 
And just make him say what he wants him to say 
But shook-ass Irv's on a string 
And Irv's so nervous that he 
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay 
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough 
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf 
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down 
But our building's made out of bricks 
So you ain't taking out shit 
I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown 
So now you try to pull a race car 
And it backfires in your face hard 
Cuz you know we don't play that black and white shit 
Plus this guy that you fucked 
When you was ecstasied up 
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch 

 
You must be taking to much (E...) 

 
Now what bothers me the most 
About hip-hop is we so close 
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac 
We just lost Jam Master J 
Big L got blasted away 
Plus we lost Bugs, Slayed Son, and Freaky Ta 
It's like a never-ending cycle 
That just seems to come full circle 
Everyone's gotta be so fucking hard 
I'm not excluding myself 
Cuz I been stupid as well 
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart 
But as we grow as men 
We learn to let shit go, but then again 
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand 
We all got reps to uphold 
When someone steps on our toes 
It's no exception, it goes for every man 
But if Irv really gave a fuck 
About Ja like he claims he does 
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs 
But he just keeps feeding him pills 
So if that E doesn't kill him 
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed 
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight 
If the situation escalates 
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game 
And if I get killed for this rap 
I got a million in cash 
That says I will get you back in Halie's name 

 
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...) 

 
Get at me, dawg 
Holla




(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
> Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will serve you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?


(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right


(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right
Aw Yeah

How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself "why do you hurt me?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know that you love me baby
Time to take you away from me...
Only over my dead body...


I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Mmm, mmm
F*ck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some 
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from

Yeah, you know me well nigga, yeah 
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the p-ssy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yea
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again 
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine 
And I be hearing sh*t you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yea
It's been that way from the beginning I just been playing, I aint even notice that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright


I know, I know that you love me baby
The time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body


You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And f-ck you to the niggas that thinks it's there time, yea
Don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever gave you a star boy
Or you wanna be a mother fuckin' funny guy
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart boy
Yea, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel now more than ever
My city love me like I'm Mac Dre in The Bay
Second Album I'm pack paving away
The backpackers are back on the band wagon like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby's mom last night
We took a picture Last night
I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And lost everything that I came with
Yea, feel like I've been here before
I still got 10 years to go, ha
And this is the only sound you should fear
And these kids where crowns over here & everything is alright...





Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I die today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucka for women licking their lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless
I saw but never noticed that a college point is right to
'Be all that you can be' posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote
But know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'd find it
And knew one day that you'd come back and rewind this, singing...



I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better tonight)
If you ain’t fucking with that
I don’t care (yeah, yeah, yeah)



Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff
I got a life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you: "You the only reason why I don't flip and go insane"
My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change
No, just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows them
Don't you ever go expose them
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself
I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's the tutor for me
Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except



Oh shit! 
Oh, I need that 
I need that sloppy 
That sloppy 
Like a Chevy in quicksand 
That sloppy 

This feelin' is unmatched 
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap 
Black (Pendleton) ball cap 
(West, west, west) 
We don't share the same synonym fall back 
(West, west, west) 
Been in it before internet had new acts 
Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack 
My innocence limited the experience lacked 
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked 
The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact 
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic 
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards 
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction 
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest 
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic 
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion 
Winnin' in every decision 
Kendrick is master and mastered it 
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction? 
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic 
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque 
But what's better than that? 
The fact it brought me back home 

We been waitin' for you 
Waitin' for you 
Waitin' for you 
Waitin' for you 

I know everything, I know myself 
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health 
I know fatality might haunt you 
I know everything, I know Compton 
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything 
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors 
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma 
I know everything, I know history 
I know the universe works mentally 
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me 
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money 
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's Ornery 
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies 
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition 
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision 
I know you know that lines from Compton School District 
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip about how it was distributed 
I know how people work, I know the price of life 
I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well 
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit 
The day I came home 


Nappy afro, gap in his smile 
Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd 
Runnin' home and the man and woman that crossed him 
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted 
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles 
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin' 
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language 
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted 
Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous 
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was takin' 
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it 
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor 
Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress 
And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil 
You spoiled by fantasies of who you are 
I feel bad for you 
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you 
If you resist, I'll back off go catch a flight or two 
But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace 
Than be an advocate go tell your homies especially 
To come back home 

This is a world premiere 
This is a world premiere 
This is a world premiere 

I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite 
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside? 
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind? 
Tell me something got me losing my mind, AH! 
You make me wanna jump 
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump 
(Let's talk about love)) 
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump 
(Let's talk about love)) 
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite 
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside? 
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind? 
Tell me something think I'm losing my mind, AH! 
I say where you at, from the front to the back 
I'm lookin' for you I react, only when you react 
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto 
When I was seventeen with the .38 special 
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real 
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel 
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway 
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway 
I can be your advocate 
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is

"Morning, Marshall."
"Morning, doc."
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
"Anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. 
Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"
"Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back"
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."
"Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and 
it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, 
we know you're a busy person."
"But I thought variety was the most important thing?"
"So what else are you thinking?"
"Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, 
and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."
"Steps?"
"Yeah, steps."
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?
"Well, twelve."
"Christ, I don't even know them all."
"Really?"
"Anything else?"
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, 
what do I do if I find myself in a situation where 
maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I 
get tempted to?"
"Take a drink."
"What?"
"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."
"Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink 
I already know what that's gonna lead me to."
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
"Man, what the fuck!?"
"Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? 
Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. 
We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall...? Marshall!?
"No, no, no, no, NO!"

Everything black, I don't want black 
I want everything black, I ain't need black 
Some white some black, I ain't mean black 
I want everything black 

Six in the mornin', fire in the street 
Burn, baby burn, that's all I wanna see 
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain 
It's such a shame they may call me crazy 
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin' 
But homie you made me 
Black don't crack my nigga 

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses 
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it 
I'm African-American, I'm African 
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village 
Pardon my residence 
Came from the bottom of mankind 
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide 
You hate me don't you? 
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture 
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey 
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me 
And this is more than confession 
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion 
I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it 
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin' 
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot 

I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black 
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black 
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black 
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks 
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back 
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block 
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black 
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that 

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society 
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me 
Curse me till I'm dead 
Church me with your fake prophesyzing that I'mma be just another slave in my head 
Institutionalize manipulation and lies 
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes 
You hate me don't you? 
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself 
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt 
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out 
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah 
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special 
CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you? 
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'? 
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree 
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred 
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification 
I'm African-American, I'm African 
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan 
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius 
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all 
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you? 
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you 
I can tell cause your ways deceitful 
Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle 
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him 
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war 
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy 
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door 
Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score 
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers 
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers" 
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day 
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays 
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements 
Or watch BET cause urban support is important 
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street? 
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me? 
Hypocrite!


I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25 sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?


One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt?
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

 


It’s like I'm in the dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won’t work
All it takes is one song on the radio you’re right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burned, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don’t suppose an explanation I’m owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I’d never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
'bout to go through’s tougher than anything I have suffered
Can’t think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"


I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy


And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pain of resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you?
The cause to my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone




I've been driving around your side of the town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders before hand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost half of a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back as they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it we are in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by Eminem
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
(Help, police!!)
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, hope you can swim good!
Now say you hate homos again!


I also represent anyone normally seen on the end of these jokes of a beat
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Backs to the wall, I’m stacking up all them odds, toilets cock
Yeah ‘cause I’m talking a lot of shit but I’m backing it all up
But in my head there’s a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I’m the ringing in your ears
I’m the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I’m your time that’s almost up that you haven’t acknowledged
Grab for some water but I’m that pill that’s too jagged to swallow
I’m the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult there
With the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mather’s the rapper’s persona’s have a facade and 
Matthew and Stan’s just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it’s gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them,
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don’t stop after they call you
The biggest laughing stock of rap who can’t call it quits
But it’s time to walk away
I’m ever guilt trip the baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time, I’m back
Before it fades into black and it’s all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers’ left off



Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh-t
When I hear talkin, I just dont know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams who Im racing with
You can see Im pacin it so that Im always chasin it
Wayne put me right here, thats who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own, but its lookin like July 4th
But I just wish theyd let you try it first
This time Im really goin off, fireworks



When I go off like July 4th
feels like a fire, Got to go higher
Its your revelation, my sweet celebration
light me like a rocket, cause can't nothing stop it
all I see is fireworks,
all i see is fireworks
every night its fireworks
every night its fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off like fireworks


I got this one girl, you know, in my life
so I say in this song, I say
I'm just such a gentleman
you should give it up for me
look at how I'm placing al my napkins and my cutlery
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you f-ck with me
who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me
yeh, I kept my wits about me luckilly
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
and you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
but I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
what an experience
you coulda been the one but it wasnt that serious
their was smoke in the air before now its me cleaing it
that felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
now I can see it in her eyes
Fireworks!

 


Everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that I still listen
and he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my Realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city I let her explore
ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close
yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first, that's why I'm really going off, Fireworks!



When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
If I die all I know is I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way
Money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'on't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'mma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D, I'm the holy one
Yeaaah, you know wassup
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong


I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdose on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it,(aye) please don't do it,(aye) cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,


Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind.
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize it happened over time
She says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you suppose to do
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions.
You know the game even got it like that.
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that.
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind (mind, mind, mind)
Tell em' I apologize it happened over time (time, time, time)
They know




I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy


Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal


Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, "Baby girl, fall in line, " ok
Made a million, off of denim
Fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "I'll nigga alert! I'll nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)




I touched down in '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with' us and we don't fuck with' y'all, it's no different over on this side
God damn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, "You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help"
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,
Ya'll keep talking 'bout who next,
But I'm about how big as it gets,
I swear ya'll just wastin' ya'll breath,
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,
I'm a make it last forever,
It's not your time 'cause I ain't done yet,
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,
I was made for all of this shit,
And I'm on the road box office sales,
I'm getting paid for all of this shit,
Ask you to please excuse my table manners,
I was making room for the table dancers,
'Cause if we judging off your advances,
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!




HOE, SHUT THE fuck UP
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rest do
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythang
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit
Good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth
Drink a fifth
Load the nine
Leave you split, in the half
Smoke a half, Need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me
And I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'
Lil' bitch


Oh Me. Oh Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that, that ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)
I'm blessed than a motherfucker,
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin' nervous, clutchin' they chests like a motherfucker,
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail,
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man,
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do. 


Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Yeah
Too late
I cant keep chasing em
Taking my life like that
Caught in a change
25 to life


I dont think she understands the sacrifices that I made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I wouldve stayed
But ive already wasted over half of my life I wouldve laid
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
Imma take control of this relationship
Command it, and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while ive stayed
Faithfull all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I aint heard you yet
Not even once say you apreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so dont hold your fucking breath
You know what youve done no need to go in depth
I told you, youd be sorry if I fucking left
Id laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny aint it, you neglected me
Did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but its,


Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life


I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that aint good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Till I snap
Dont think im loyal
All I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Dont I give you enough of my time
You dont think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why im married to you still man I dont know
But tonight im serving you with papers
Im divoricing you
Go marry someone else and make em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat em like you dont need them and they aint worthy of you
Feed em the same shit that you made me eat
Im moving on forget you oh,
Now im special, I aint felt special when I was with you
All I ever felt was dissed
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
Its ridiculus
And still I stick with this
Im sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Your addicive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away from
Im addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
Im drawn to this, so I guess imma mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time imma
Aint changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abiss
You screaming as I walk out that ill be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop
Im leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And its just


Too late for the other side
Caught in a change
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a change
25 to life
Too late
Caught in a change
25 to life


Worst...


Mothafucka never loved us, fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now, still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions, nigga we don't know shit
Flexing! Nigga, I'm just flexing
Nigga never loved us, do it look like we stressing?
Look at you, look at you and look at you, aww, I'm glad that they chose us
Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish, just to see if I'm finished


On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us... Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up?
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior


Hold up, hold my phone, mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us, now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us, so everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up! You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B




Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothing changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm coming back on my worst behavior


Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior

Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit ain’t my fault, girl cause I'm lonely

Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody’s house that you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it, I’m not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae

This shit ain’t my fault

You know a lotta girls be...thinking my songs about them, but
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...


Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say you da fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate,
Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the matt and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

Cause,



Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffin theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 

Uhh, ah yea
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money
You know who you are, I got ya




Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night


Okay, back when I was sleepin’ in my mama’s crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin’ seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you
Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you
I'm saying...


Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
She got me
And we are we are we are
She got me


Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies' gon' disown a nigga
Like, give me 20 dolla, dolla
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', "Please play!"
For pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever
But...



Boomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm... (Louuuu)
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work a night shift

Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift

Young, but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Louuuu)

If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I'm never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?

Cause if we ever got together
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever
And well that ain't my thing cause I
I ain't even got my own
And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
And I thought about the things we did
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
I don't wanna wait forever

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

Hello, hello?
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Everything's so sad when you look back

On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick don't it
Reflection bring regrets don't it
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end

It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good

It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen, you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soul mate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you

She said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

These days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

Alls my life I has to fight, nigga 
Alls my life I... 
Hard times like God 
Bad trips like: "God!" 
Nazareth, I'm fucked up 
Homie you fucked up 
But if God got us we then gon' be alright 

 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
We gon' be alright 
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
Huh? We gon' be alright 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 

Uh, and when I wake up 
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut 
Behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down 
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down 
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life 
Painkillers only put me in the twilight 
What pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight 
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like 
Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy 
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow 
So my karma come and Heaven no preliminary hearing 
So my record and my motherfucking gang can stand in silence for the record 
Tell the world I know it's too late 
The hoes, the girls think I gone crazy 
Try and fight my vices all day 
Won't you please believe when I say 

When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga 
When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?" 
And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga 
I'm at the preacher's door 
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright 

What you want, a house or a car 
40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar 
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog 
Motherfucker you can live at the mall 
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know when it's illegal 
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero 
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal 
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you 
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you 
In the presence of your chico... ah! 
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool 
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you 
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog thats all 
Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all 
I rap, I'm black, on track and rest assured 
My rights, my wrongs are right till I'm right with God 

I keep my head up high 
I cross my heart and hope to die 
Lovin' me is complicated 
Too afraid, a lot of changes 
I'm alright and you're a favorite 
Dark nights in my prayers 

I remembered you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room 
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went runnin' for answers

"Morning, Marshall."
"Morning, doc."
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
"Anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. 
Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"
"Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back"
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."
"Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and 
it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, 
we know you're a busy person."
"But I thought variety was the most important thing?"
"So what else are you thinking?"
"Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, 
and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."
"Steps?"
"Yeah, steps."
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?
"Well, twelve."
"Christ, I don't even know them all."
"Really?"
"Anything else?"
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, 
what do I do if I find myself in a situation where 
maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I 
get tempted to?"
"Take a drink."
"What?"
"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."
"Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink 
I already know what that's gonna lead me to."
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
"Man, what the fuck!?"
"Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? 
Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. 
We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall...? Marshall!?
"No, no, no, no, NO!"

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated
against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,
give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the
evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but
they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...



I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm
cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I
never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me
inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a
multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father
must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,
no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I
couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it
work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm
man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest
shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot
Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...



Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you
think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'
your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'
through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of
Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew
up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made
that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your
gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna
know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but
you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't
admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare
you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in
hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess
what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...



Loving you is complicated 

I place blame when you steal 
Place shame when you steal 
Feel like you ain't shit 
Feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself 
Breakin' on marble floors 
Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours 
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special 
What can I blame him for 
Nigga I can name several 
Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin' 
A baby inside, just a teenager where's your antennas 
Whats your intentions where is the influence you speak of 
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her 
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure you ain't no leader 
I never liked you, forever despise you I don't need you 
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you 
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, thats for dedication 
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent 
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it 

Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof 
I can feel you vibin', recognize that your ashamed of me 
Yes I hate you too 

House keeping 
 
House keeping 
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto! 
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto¡ 
!Disculpe! 

Are you the reason why mama and them leavin' 
No you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it 
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it 
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it 
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out 
You was deserted, where was your antennas again? 
Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend? 
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend 
A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend 
Little brother, you promised you’d watch him before they shot him 
Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches 
You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven 
You even faced time instead of a hospital visit 
You should thought he would recover, well 
The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real 
Then he died, God himself will say "you fuckin' failed" 
You ain't try 

I know your secrets nigga 
Mood swings is frequent nigga 
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga 
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin' nigga 
Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and your the reason nigga 
And if this bottle could talk *gulp* I cry myself to sleep 
Bitch everything is your fault 
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend 
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed 
I know your secrets 
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin' 
And that time you *gulp* I'm bout to hurl 
I'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you 
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof 
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago 
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago 
And if those mirrors could talk it would say "you gotta go" 
And if I told your secrets 
The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness

{verse 1}
all niqht i've, been starin'
can you tell i want you ?
can't be too, wide open
but there's nothin, i won't do
ohhh... just want  you to know

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

{verse 2}
I wish i... wasn't famous
I wish i... was still in school
So that i can have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you crazy

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious


{fadey fade away.... lls .}

Hollywood Cole
Go
Ay Hollywood
Hollywood Cole
Go

You wanna know just where I'm at
Well let me tell you 'bout it
I put my city on the map
But let me tell you 'bout it
They tryna say I can't come back
Ay let me tell you 'bout it
Man fuck them nigga I come back
Ay let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it
Hands up, everybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like "man that's what everybody say"
Go and pop the trunk and everybody dead
Everybody scared of the nigga
Aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter
Never bitter
Niggas is faker than anime
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, woah
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake
Fuck good nigga we demand great
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait
The best kept secret
Even hoes try and keep it and I leak the damn tape
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Even secret service couldn't keep the man safe

I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

Get off my dick, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick nigga)
Get off my dick, bitch, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick, bitch, woah

Man fuck them niggas I come home and I don't tell nobody
They gettin' temporary dough and I don't tell nobody
Lord will you tell me if I changed, I won't tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine, and I won't tell nobody
This is the part that the thugs skip
Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through
(The break up)
Get to know somebedy and you learn a lot about 'em
When we long for you, start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breath without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em
It's called love
Niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
No more, no more
It's called love
Niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
(Nigga I don't sing about this shit no more)
But there a nigga in the club singing

I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

Get off my dick
But every nigga in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
Got all the bitches in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
And all they mamas let their kids sing it
Sing this song yeah
The baby mamas and the mistresses
Singing this song yeah
Song yeah, song song yeah

(The make up)
This shit is retarded
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless
That's a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Ariel Heights
Here's a scenario
Young Cole pockets is fat like little Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah fuck nigga I'm very sure
Fuck the rest I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home I'm the best in the South
When I'm in LA I'm the best in the West
You can test, you can test, I'mma stretch niggas out
Oooh I'mma stretch niggas out
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out
This shit for everbody on my testicle
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, ho 

I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock


She got the good good
She Michael Jackson bad
Im attracted to her
For her attractive ass
And now we murders
Because we kill time
I knock her lights out
And she still shine
I hate to see her go
But I love to watch her leave
But I keep her runnin back and forth
Like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day
Hot as a summers eve
Young money thieves
Steal your heart with ease


I like the way you walkin
If your walkin my way
Im that red bull
Now lets fly away
Lets buy a place
With all kinds of space
Ill let you be the judge
And Im the case
Im Gudda Gudda
I put her under

No Stevie wonder
She dont even wonder
Cuz she know she bad
And I got her n*gger
Grocery bag

[Young Lloyd)
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby

But I cant meet you in the lobby
Girl I gotta watch my back
Cuz Im not just anybody

Just to get beside her

And let the rest surprise her
Thats when we disappear
You need GPS to find her
Oh that was your girl?

Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby

She like tanning
I like staying in
She like romancing
I like rollin with friends
She said Im caged in
I think her conscience is
she watching that oxygen
Im watching ESPN
But when that show ends
She all over my skin
Lotion
Slow emotions
Roller coastin
Like back and forth
Hold it
She pose like its for posters
And I poke like Im suppose to
Take this photo if you for me
she said dont you ever show this
Im to loyal and to focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this she rejoiced this
She said your words gets me open
So I closed it where your clothes
Im only lovin for the moment


She aint got a man
But she not alone
Miss. Independent
Yeah she got her own
Hey gorgeous

(Young Lloyd)
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left.
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Nights over goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's dumb enough out there I blind fold her,
She still comes back to my crib, Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But i wont buy her a soda Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of fritos I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would i buy you a gay ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Man TIP told me on this hoe tip
Best tip I could give you to hip you
Never let these traits trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, shit
Dig you a hole
Take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, its you, but fuck it TIP, it's cool
I'm chillin like a Villain
Like the penguin in it's fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
before I tie a fucking knot I'd tie you in one bitch
you think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger although a nickle might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
there's a bombshell, scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was some motherfucking stud
Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way fo shizzle
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slot checks stob bizzle
So fuck scissors these checkers are bust like a blood blister


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP
And each one thinks "Say this shit"
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, put a sticky note to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gonna tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote 

 Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

 Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see


Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right 
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
We elevated to new heights premeditated 
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate 
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance 
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop 
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know


So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

 Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see


So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack 


So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become

I got a bone to pick 
I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again 
(Aye aye nigga whats happenin' nigga, K Dot back in the hood nigga) 
I'm mad (He mad), but I ain't stressin' 
True friends, one question 

Bitch where you when I was walkin'? 
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta 
Black man taking no losses 
Bitch where you when I was walkin'? 
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him 

When you got the yams (What's the yams?) 
The yam is the power that be 
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street 
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can) 
I can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer 
What the fuck happened? 
(Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell 
But most of you share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell 
(A two man cell) 
Something's in the water (Something's in the water) 
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller 

When you got the yams (What's the yams?) 
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor 
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires 
24/7, 365 days times two 
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage 
Just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say... 

You goat mouth mammy fucker 
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves 
Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help 
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail 
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left 
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton" 
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest 
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too 
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' woo woo 
Ah yeah fuck the judge 
I made it past 25 and there I was 
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him 
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina 
Screamin' "Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok?" 
Limo tinted with the gold plates 
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast 
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfucking king 

(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk) 
We want the funk 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
(Do you want the funk?) 
We want the funk 
(Do you want the funk?) 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence

Better watch out sucker now I got ya where I want ya,
onslaught, coming and Im packing in my lunch up,
bunch a missile launcher and a bunch a contra,
van van full of ganja, now come on jump,
man stop marchin marshall on my gotcha,
doin’ the cha cha and the kucharcha with a quadri-plegic,
boogieing down to Frank Sinatra,
Lyndsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya,
who da knew the puda do ta me whats its done,
such cynicism when this isn’t in my system,
blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lip son,
so much on my hands, i got to give my kids a fist pump,
Chris-to-pher Reeves swimming in my swim trunks,
Mister, “help me” whats he said to me and then sunk,
women skinning them and cutting them up in chunks,
in comes the woman with cocoa butter skin ones,


Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-buffalo bill,
skin em up, hym em,
sew em up in those kilts, up in those kilts,
upa upa up in those kilts,
man you don’t want to go up in those hills,
up in those hills, uppa up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill,
buffa-buffalo bill,


Always, you can see em lurking in the hallways,
carcasues of caucasion females in his draw space,
how the hell did he fit em all in such a small space,
hide em in the wall but how long will the dry wall take,
well f-ck it then, I got nothing but time, I’ll wait,
until its dries for the moment i guess your all safe,
after I sand it and buff it I guess that I’ll paint,
my chainsaw’s outta gas my regular saw aint,
now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling,
you can even hear the evil spirits coming from within,
someones in, the back of my damn house rummaging,
its a girl, she looks pretty thin but I want to skin,
been on the hunt again, when will it ever end,
Evelyn why you trying to fight you will never win,
http://www.elyricsworld.com/buffalo_bill_lyrics_eminem.html
severing legs, arms, damn there goes another limb,
pull the lever then trap door, death is evident




Now what you know about Buffalo Bill,
nothing so chill,
f-cking hoe, you better f-cking hold still,
make sure none of that lotion in that bucket don’t spill,
cut em gut em and just keep stuffing those girls,
man I think she had enough of those pills,

sedate her, then I wait her come back later just to clutch on those steel blades
braids, baby when I cut ya dont squeal
I hate the loud noises I f-cking told you,
I keep hearing voices like
wouldn’t you like to go and get ya put ya knife
and push it right through it while ya put ya shishkebab skewer
into a barbecue or would ya do to her what you usually do to a girl who’s skins newer,


In a World of Sin doer this is turning into a torment tournament of sorts,
Christmas Ornament you are,


I”ll be sure to Gensu ya til there’s no more skin to ya,
boo ya who ya think you f-cking with,
duck because here he comes again,





I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly,
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it

Just hold on we're going home (home)

I’m going through changes
I’m going through changes


Lately I really, feel like I’m rolling for like Philly,
I feel like I’m losing control of myself,
I sincerely apologize if all that I sound like, is I’m complaining,
But life keeps on complicating, an’ I’m debating,
On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls,
Can see I’m grievin’, I try and hide it,
But I can’t, why do I act like I’m all high and mighty,
When inside, I’m dying, I am finally realizing I need help.
I can’t do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I’ve been having ups and downs,
Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying,
Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here.
I’m hatin’ my reflection, I walk around the house tryin’ to fight mirrors,
I can’t stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie,
I’m afraid if I close my eyes I might see her,
Shit…




I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin’ at noon,
Yeah dad’s in a bad mood, he’s always snappin’ at you.
Marshall what happened at you, you can’t stop with these pills,
And you’ve fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughin’ at you.
It become a problem you’re too pussy to tackle, get up,
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled.
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed,
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust,
Nah, it ain’t like Doody to do that,
He wouldn’t fuckin’ shoot at, no-body, he fights first,
But dwellin’ on it only makes the night worse,
Now I’m poppin Vic’s, perks and Methadone pills.
Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it,
Fuckin’ drug dealers hang around me like “yes man”,
And they gon’ do whatever I says when, I says it,
It’s in their best interest to protect their investment.
And I just lost my fuckin’ best friend, so fuck it, I guess then…



Don’t know what I’m gonna do,
but I just keep on going through changes


My friends can’t understand this new me,
That’s understandable man, but think how bananas you’d be,
You’d be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.
And everybody’s lookin’ at you, what you want me to do,
I’m startin’ to live like a recluse and the truth is,
Fame startin’ to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low.
I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin’ the same damn DVD,
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive.
And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin’ pills’ll make me feel alright.
And if I’m still awake in the middle of the night,
I just take a couple more, yeah you’re motherfuckin’ right,
I ain’t slowin’ down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, dole em out,
Daddy, don’t you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground.
Fuck, don’t I know the sound of that voice,
Yeah baby hold me down.




Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow I’m pullin’ through.
Swear when I come back I’ma be bulletproof.
I’ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few,
Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth.
Shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?
I think about the things I would never got to say to you,
I’d never get to make it right, so here’s what I came to do.
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too,
I still love your mother, that’ll never change,
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together.
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it,
But I swear on everything, I’d do anything for her on anyday.
There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains,
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn’t any pain.
But I can’t pretend there ain’t, I ain’t placin’ any blame,
I ain’t pointin’ fingers, heaven knows I never been a saint.
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history,
But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say,
I miss you self consciously, wish it didn’t end this way.
But I just had to get away, don’t know why,
I don’t know what else to say, I guess I’m…



Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach

I'm in Miami
I need to call up Miss Cassidy
My name is party, not participation
Sorry for the miscommunication
I need a drink and some tequila with you
You know what I'm trying to do
Hey, let's pop the E off at Liv
I've got some time here to blow
I've got the money to blow
I've got the money and blow
Don't have to guess how I know
Oh, it's a secret just for me, I'll keep it
You old niggas boring as bones
You put the PARTY tape on
You know what's going on
You know what's going on
She keep it wet like tsunami
She think she sunk the Titanic
I get her hot like Wasabi
She think it's wavy and gnarly
I think I'mma pop one for you
Drink one for you

Still in Miami
Most of these girls are too messy
I've got to do some reflecting
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction
I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like brrrrr
I'm on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type
I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight
PND ain't with the ray tay, you know Jay Wray
Got girls here going way way way way way way
Sauga city trip the pay day
Glo'd up off a gate way, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in their feelings these days
All in their feelings these days
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes
You should be afraid

I'm preaching, oooh
Preaching
Preaching, babe
Preaching, whooo
I'm a finally, finally
Yeah

You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Cause sometimes you feel tired, Feel weak
And when you feel weak
You feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
You gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that sh*t out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And be a quitter
No matter how bad you just wanna fall flat on your face

Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps as long as you feel 'em
To the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
Your coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a f*ck.


Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this sh*t till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out
I'ma rip this sh*t till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when your real
and you spit and people are feeling your sh*t.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much sh*t as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end.
Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this sh*t that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outcast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the sh*t does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people got a f*cking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you’ve got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.



Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
what is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And its absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.



Until the roof
The roof comes off
Until my legs
give out from underneath me

I will not fall,
I will stand tall,
Feels like no one could beat me.

I want you to understand something
that when I come up in this b-tch I want the fans jumping,
I want the fist pumping in the air,
I dont look like a millionnaire,
but I feel like a million bucks,
ladies wont ya fill your cups,
Shadys come to fill ya up,
if your a D or a C cup
you can even be a B
its just me and DRE
youll be in the ER well be strapped with so much TNT,
we may blow no not even CPR from the EMT
could help you to resuscitate
you busters must be flustered wait
you cant cut the mustard, whats your problem cant you bust a grape,
whats my name, shady came and just crushed the game,
its really not even fair to them,
cos they pale in comparisons
so much they might aswell wear a skin,
dont you just wish you could share his pen
cos this sh-ts getting embarrassing,
the fog is stinking the air is thin,
cos he wont even let them try to breathe,
da da di di da di dee, he makes it look so easy,
girl you just hit the lottery,


now this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on,
and hell breaks loose,
try to restrain us you cant contain us,
we still gonna make a statement no matter what we do,
everywhere we go it seems were looking for any excuse to just cut loose,
so this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose,


This is when sh-ts hits the fan,
like it just splattered on stan
this is the only moment that matters,
ya homie rolled in with Mathers,
like chaos erupts Ems in back Dres in the front
so do what we say at once this songs like a singer it hunts (?),


It makes em stay in a trance
no choice they have to dance,


Its like the play-off just making sure that we stay in the hunt
take a day off of what man you better lay off the blunts
you must be smoking something
you think I aint smoking nothing stay off my nuts,
now hit the floor baby time to wipe away all the rust,
shake all them cobwebs loose,
loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose,
yeah girl shake that caboose
I dont wanna see you try to make no excuse,
DRE is on the loose,
A Mongoose when its comes to the chronic use,
you know I cant stand to lose,
me and my goons are like animals,
we come through like a pack of wolves,
so we came here to retract the roof,
yeah man aint that the truth,
girl your mans like in the booth
definitely back up in this b-tch,
this is when all hell breaks loose,




Now I know your feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words,
A murderer in the flow, liquid courage im finna blow
as soon as we hit the door power surges head to toe
Im sure to push it as far as words are meant to go,
were in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows,
ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block widcha hoe,
with speakers knocking its 3 0 clock
me and Doc then proceed to drop (?)
and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door,


Yeah so let us in fore we huff and puff and we blow,
we aint bluffin for nothing
well knock the stuffing out ya
revenge is so sweet, move til ya injure ya feet
yeah move or lose it three,
move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably,
pass some of that (?) lil right there,
that would be pretty stupid to me,
born and raised in the CPT,
yeah Los Angeles whos in the streets,
them haters hating on me,
but I refuse to lose any sleep,
keep that deuce deuce in the seat,
Dre fall off thats news to me,




F-ck you, motherf-cker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga you ain't sh-t
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga you ain't sh-t
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be f-ckin' with you anyway, I need a baller ass, boss ass nigga
You'se a off brand ass nigga, everybody know it, your homies know it, everybody f-ckin' know
F-ck you nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the f-ck is really going on?

This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made end's meet, eatin' your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes without a Mercedes Benz and twenty four inch rims, five percent tint, and air conditioning vents
Hell f-ckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullsh-t, matador, matador, had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious, kept me up watchin'
Pornos and poverty, apology? No
Watch you volunteer it it while people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has it's day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter fact it need interest, matter fact it's nine inches
Matter fact see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin', my consensus
Been relentless, f-ck forgiveness, f-ck your feelings
F-ck your sources, all distortion, if you f-ck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
F-ck you think is bullsh-t, porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is deaf, a state of decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I the picked cotton that made you rich
Now my dick ain't free

I'mma get my Uncle Sam to f-ck you up
You ain't no king 

Complexion (two-step) 
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love) 
Complexion (two-step) 
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love) 

Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun 
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done 
Sneak (dissin’) 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga 
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you 
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down 
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention 

Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' Sun 
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run 
Sneak (dissin') 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga 
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you 
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down 
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention 
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival 
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival 
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken 
By different shades of faces 
Then wit told me, "You're womanless, woman love the creation" 
It all came from God then you was my confirmation 
I came to where you reside 
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes 
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with... 

You like it, I love it 
You like it, I love it 

Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2pac 
Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die 
Color of your skin, color of your eyes 
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby 
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey 
All my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave 
12 years of age, thinkin’ my shade too dark 
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid 
And forcin’ my dark side like a young George Lucas 
Light don’t mean you smart, bein’ dark don’t make you stupid 
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin’ “Woohah!” 
Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored 
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times 
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion 
It ain’t complex to put it in context 
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context 
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest 
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed 
Ain’t no stress, jigga boos wanna be 
I ain’t talkin’ Jay, I ain’t talkin’ Bey 
I’m talkin’ days we got school watchin’ movie screens 
And spike yourself esteem 
The new James Bond gon’ be black as me 
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea 
And it’s all beautiful to me 
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens 
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing 

Barefoot babies with no cares 
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car? 
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse 
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth

Yeah!
Stat quo
Doc Dre
I representin the A town
A town
Aye aye aye
I'm comin' from the A town

Shady Aftermath

Knockin' crowds off the floor

When I walks through the door
It's him
Tell a friend
But you already know
Act stupid and lose it
Don't fuck with quo

Not the usual
Sippin' cognac between two beautiful
Two bitches at the club
Talk shit at your funeral
I came to get a buzz and crunk
Understand yo

He's jumpin
God damn it's slow
I'm cooler than cool
Cause my temperature is thirty below
I'm checkin' the scene for new cunt
Droppin' it low
Shakin' they ass
Backin' it up
Fast or slow

You know this thing don't stop till I say so
Now get low

You know this club don't close till I say so

Ain't no children

Cinderella Man (x4)

Who can catch lighting in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin out the nozzle on a fire hose, cry it and swallow

Cinderella Man (x4)

Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, takes his hands and cup em
Spin around to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff em

Cinderella Man (x4)


There's a storm comin that the weatherman couldn't predict
I've start to ball prick you better flea cuz I get ticked
it's a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch ya to the ground ya trick
It's a trap, fuck my last CD that shit's in my trash
I'll be God damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in a blink of an eye, so betcha I'll last
So keep winkin and blowin kisses cuz ur flirtin with death
I'm destroyin ur livelihood, I ain't just hurtin ur rep
I catch a flow and get goin,
No remorse, I'm showin they slowin, for no one, knowin there is nothing you can do about it
Zeroin in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I'll shut your lane down, if you can spot the parked in at 2
Arsenic flower, lighter fluid, saliva, what can you do
lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com
Go get ur crew, hype you up, stand behind you like "woooooooo"
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how bout you?
Now guess who....(Hey)
Here's a clue....(Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
Now, what's his name

Cinderella Man (x4)


If I had a time machine
I'd be...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Music is my time machine
So call me...

Cinderella Man (x4)


Fuck catchin lighting, he struck it
Screamed shut up at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward

Cinderella Man (x4)

Rewound the future to the present
Paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker he's the shit right now
he's...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Cinderella man sent to fell Shady dey
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell from hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with this Cinderella story,
nor did he come to do the same, or can't afford to be a lamo in this day and age
And at this stage in the game, mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old H-I to the new Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah
The coupe de gras, raise em high, in the sky
People are tryin to bring this place alive
Thanks for bein patient I will make no more mistakes,
shit my Potatoes baked homie the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin weed, yea faggot the stakes are high
Shit I ain't even supposed to be here by the grace of God
By the skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts I skated by
Now ya'll are on in ice with ankle weights I hate to lie
Now how fuckin irritated are you, how much in ur face am I
And there ain't shit you can do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and I'm a spittin image I mirror it
When I stand near it, ur pussy lyric I couldn't hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
Who? (Hey)
Here's a clue (Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater and lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
now...what's his name





I hate rich niggas goddammit
Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit
Who you had to kill, who you had to rob
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top dammit.
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator no ladder money
Escalating new caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money.
Crookest smile nigga momma never had the money damn
I ain't trippin' a nigga Jordan I ain't Pippen yeah
Up the steps I ain't slippin'
Tears blood sweat I ain't crippin, Pierce
A song you can sing along with when you down
So I let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas you think she out there getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga plus dawg I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crash and only it killed his lame ass
I'd be glad its that nigga
Did Kate dirty now it's back to broke
Refund check she used that to float.
Momma gets depressed falls in love with the next maniac
On crack use that to cope.
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crash the boat could of drowned
But I grabbed the rope

There go you (x3)
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew(x3)


You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul and uh
How much for your soul and uh


I hate rich niggas goddammit
Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now hear my shit and tried to switch now.
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't it more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power
Fuck it more to you, so I threw you
And it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for more money like Damon Wayons
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but it just ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watching little Jermaine do his thang before he made a name
It's like ? Basquiat
He gave it all he got now the nigga don't paint the same.
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Thinking old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame
My brain the same, yeah nigga at least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy motherfucker you just afraid of change.
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you.
And I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more.
Tad bit extreme I know.
Money can't save your soul.
But there go you

There go you
There go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And nigga who you (x3)
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew



How much for your soul and uh

Uh

But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinking Ima quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?

I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost


I’ve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn’t change
And I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? please don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours we both know
We know, they don’t get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste,ah
Pushing me away so I give her space,ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
I’ll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don’t know
Trying to run from that, say you’re done with that
On your face girl, it just don’t show
When you’re ready, just say you’re ready
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
And the party's over, just don’t forget me
We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won’t ever have to worry,
You won’t ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes


Cause if you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost


Yeah
It’s my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can’t deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don’t say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you’re following your heart
Cause your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know, you hate being alone
You ain’t the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin’ to save you
Instead they say,
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true


I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost 


Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn’t everything
I’m having a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that i'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time 
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well never mind,
I I I tried to told you, drizzy still ain’t nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cars saying fuck ya life
Okay now we outta here
Toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up
I got the voodoo for you bitches
I’m busy getting rich, I don’t want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double
Famous like a drug that I've taken too much
I never ever trip
Just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does


I'm about whatever man..
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night..
Whole crews in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team. Man I love my team..
I would die for these niggas..


Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her Imma get her
I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mix tape?
That was just a keepsake
Bought the president the Louie presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks I ain’t talking about the peach state
Man for Petes sake scratch that, sweep stakes
(hahahaha)
Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you like no
I’m a bad bitch I ain’t never been a mixed breed.
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed
M M M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
But I collect 100 thou at the venue
And pop bottles with my team young money til the death of me


I'm about whatever man..
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night..
Whole crews in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team. Man I love my team..

Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night..
Whole crews in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team. Man I love my team..
I would die for these niggas

I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous a**
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your a**
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that s*** you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go maybe I'll stay
Maybe I'll stay
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go

He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's about to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood

Ay from the dark I showed you my scars and I told you girl, I won't lie
If we at war, then this is a war that I can't afford (No I, I, I)
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I...I.. cry
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile
Lately
It's been hard for me to smile
It's been hard for me to smile
It's been hard for me to smile

If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home

He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's about to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic
I like to ask it, don't ask for
Your favorite rapper

(He dead) yessir
(Amen) chuuch
(He dead) I killed him
(Amen) bitch

And this is rigamortis
And it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus
The Matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit
You an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme
If you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin
And then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph
Into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures
My listeners reply and tell me
That you biting style
You got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while
Just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight
We always making them duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI, just might investigate
This fucking parasite

(He dead)
(Amen)

That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity
This is studio felony
There would not be so many
And cool enough for the 70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch
And bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant
Rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody
Couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q
It's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
So the system ain't why we ___
Ain't nothing else you can do

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I killed him
(He dead) hahaha
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask who your favorite rapper

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask who your favorite rapper

I rapped him and made him Casper
I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya
I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, once you sinister
Bible study faster
You hypocrite is reaction of blasphemy
I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done
And tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds
Don't talk to be bout no money
The sun is under my feet
And I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap
My statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek
And I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody done see
Some persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the streets
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick, in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
And y'all fucks, never could hassle me
And y'all luck, just ran out you'll see

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen

I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

You understand me?
Showtime, headlines
Big time, sunshine, tote nines
Bust mines, flatline, hard grind
High life, stay fly as jet time
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga
Stunt nigga
I might just bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe

Look inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt and never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don’t know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


I’m trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I’m looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I’ll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


You ain’t heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don’t you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3′s in the air I can see you are – in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I’ll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it’s alive
My new year’s resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say – Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe




We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!


Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here


Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth
Cuz the people that hurt can’t understand it
You speakin outlandish, I’m ashamed how to make it all work
Another planet, it’s a short term role for me
I rec it’s all for me, it’s just mo with me
And you’re here for you too here can re-persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin off, I ain’t takin off these pistons
I’m takin off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much it’d cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a shortterm goal, no sky is the limit
I’m past that, now pass that
A word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours


I see myself performing at
Soldout shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammys, winning 5 awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Can’t imagine how it feels
That’s why I’m smiling every day
Cause my dream ain’t far away


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


You’re looking at me and tell me I’m blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I’m at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, I’m reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I’m a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow I’mma take that I’ll never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I root
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin to you, I was walkin it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello


And I’m so happy I cry
Cause I can’t believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it’s so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you play so hard
And you’ve come so far
And you go, that is the time for you to leave your more
And I’m gonna do it
Watch me


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better 

K dot, pick up the phone, nigga. Every time I call, it's going to voice mail. 
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga. 
No socks and skinny jeans and shit. Call me on Shaniqua's phone 

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo 
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo 
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo 
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo 
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce 
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies 
On the dead homies 

I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga 
My lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga 
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga 
Fuck what they talkin' bout, your shit is where its at, my nigga 
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game 
You wore no chain in this game your hood, your name in this game 
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up 
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them benjamin's go cuddle up 
Skip, hop, trip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock 
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this" 
Thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix 
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras 
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers 
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you 
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you 

Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked 
The little homies called, they said, "The enemies done cliqued up" 
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio? 
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio 
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous 
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras 
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin' 
Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer 
The streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town 
From Compton to Congress, it’s set trippin’ all around 
Ain’t nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans 
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’? 
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs 
Make it they promise to fuck with you 
No condom they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?" 

Everybody want to talk about who this and who that 
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black 
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’ 
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum 
Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit 
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since 
Don’t ask about no camera back at award shows 
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my foes 
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it 
I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button 
Had the Coast on standby 
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box” 
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide 
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets 
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats 
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay 
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game" 

I remember you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence 
Sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screaming in a hotel room 
I didn't want to self-destruct 
The evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went running for answers 
Until I came home 
But that didn't stop survivors guilt 
Going back and forth 
Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned 
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
But while my loved ones was fighting 
A continuous war back in the city 
I was entering a new one

We got a young brother to stand for something! 
We got a young brother that believe in the all of us! 
Brother Kendrick Lamar! He's not a rapper, he's a writer, he's an author! 
And if you read between the lines, we'll learn how to love one another! But you can't do that 
Right on 
I said, you can't do that - without loving yourself first 

I done been through a whole lot 
Trial, tribulations, but I know God 
Satan wanna put me in a bow-tie 
Praying that the holy water don't go dry, yeah yeah 
As I look around me 
So many motherfuckers wanna down me 
But ain't no nigga never drown me 
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

Everybody looking at you crazy (Crazy) 
What you gone do? (What you gone do?) 
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving) 
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you) 
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart 
On my sleeve let the runway start 
You know the miserable do love company 
What do you want from me and my scars? 
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence 
How many times our potential was anonymous? 
How many times the city making me promises? 
So I promise this 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street 
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police 
And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends 
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme, yup 
These days of frustration keep y'all on ducking rotation 
I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum basis 
Dreams of realities peace 
Blow steam in the face of the beast 
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now 
The strong in me, I still smile 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

Walk my barefeet (Walk my barefeet) 
Down, down valley peak (Down, down valley peak) 
I keep my fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum) 
I keep my heart undone (My heart undone) 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

I went to war last night 
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic 
I'm a do it 'til I get it right 
I went to war last night 
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent 
Duckin' every other blessin', l can never see the message 
I can never take the lead, I can never bob and weave 
For my nigga that be letting 'em annihilate me 
And the sound is moving in a meteor speed 
From a 100 to a billion lay my body in the street 
Keep my money in the ceiling let my mama know I'm free 
Give my story to the children and the lesson they can read 
And the glory to the feeling of the only unseen 
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!" 

I lost my head, I must've misread what the good book said 
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside 
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called "Hi! My Name Is" dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I've went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain, the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to…

I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

I know what it's like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in that trailer park?
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than make another motherfucking "We Made You", uh
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania,
So when they empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was... gone

I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way o-o-out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear

Attention all units, attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
He could be coming at your girlfriend next


There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him unmercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone


Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!

I've been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? It can't be
They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
I promise to always give you me, the real me


Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go


Owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright life'd make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumbs could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do


Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Wait until the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there
There is no right or wrong
Only a song
I like to write alone
Be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasin' panties, gettin' dome
Had no clue what you was goin' through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl
Damn she so selfless, but she put up with my way
Because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together
(I love you mama)

Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it

Another day another rhyme ho
Another day another time zone
Today I woke up feelin' horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playin' on my trumbone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me
Nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot dog, catch up to me nigga
Uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was ridin' on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sittin' on the hood of this bitch
Like thanks for the view
Waitin' on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit gave you the blueprint don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showin' off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowin' soft
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing
Gettin' head like a coin toss
Too easy

Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it


Cause some things just don’t change
It’s better when they stay the same
Althought the whole world knows your name
So on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game
Ooooohhhhhhh
It shouldn’t be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice you remain
fuck em’ all, tell ‘em all eat shit, here we go again

So, god damn… is it that time again already
Haha, you don’t look too happy to see me
fuck man, don’t everybody welcome me back at once
All right, fuck ya’ll then


You can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, I’m nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, Dog fall back you mutts
fuck your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy
fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck sick mummy
And my nuts licked, gobble ‘em up trick, yummy
 b**ch you don’t fucking think that I know that you suck dick dummy?
You’ll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it’s funny!
Shawty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don’t listen to ‘em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker
Motherfucker might aswell let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, cause I’m just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on, cause you wen’t and pissed me off
Now I’m sitting and pissing on everbody
give a fuck if it’s right or wrong
So buck the buddah, light a bong
But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, cmon


Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh


fuck it I’m a loose cannon, Bruce Banner’s back in the booth
Ya’ll are sitting ducks, I’m the only goose standing
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my d*ck in a circle, but I’m not fucking around motherfucker
I’ll show you pussy footin, I’ll kick a bitch in the cunt
Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin’, you musta mistook me for some sissy
Soft punk looking for some nookie or boosom
Go ahead, fucking hater push me
I told you ain’t no fucking way to shush me
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G’s up
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!)
Man chill, nah I can’t god damnit
Rap is a land fill, drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can’t fill
shit the day that happens the world’ll stop spinning
And Michael J. Fox’ll come to a stand still
During an earthquake, urine in your face
Cause you’re fake, ahh what the fuck, that hurt wait!
Ahh what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening
Alright then I quit, god I give up
Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To hell I’ll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh


How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day
til I hang up the mic and it’s time for me to say
So long, til then i drop the fucking bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long
If you don’t like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh b**ches don’t like that, homie I’ll be nicer to women
When aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming
lyrics courtesy of killer hip hop dot com
Man I’m a cold soul, I roll solo so
So don’t compare me to them other bums over there
It’s like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
I’m bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I’ll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

(Outro)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I don’t know, I don’t know what caused, I don’t know what caused me to be this wayme to be this way
I don’t know, I don’t know by I probably be this way til my dying day
I don’t know why I’m so, I’m so cold beat bangs, I don’t need to say
I guess this is how you made me



Uh
I’m just so far gone
October’s own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screaming in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on
Where did we go wrong
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game
And its one I can’t post pone
Meaning if it rains
I’m the one its raining on
With my diamond chain’s on
Still nothing setting stone
Women borrow sweaters
That I spray with my cologne
And tell me don’t forget them
And I promise that I won’t
Feeling so distant from everyone I’ve known
To make everybody happy
I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown
Parties that we’ve thrown
I done more for this city
Than these rappers that have blown
Its only been 3 years
Look at how I’ve grown
I’m just in my zone
I call this shit the calm

Yeah

But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom
And I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay
And it wont even take that long
You can see it in my face
Even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school
Its proven and its known
I’m sittin’ in a chair
But in the future, it’s a throne
I know you like to worry
It’d be better if you don’t
Cuz….


You know…
Everything gone be all right
I promise
I apologize to you know
Put y’all in this position
40 Mama always say
Don’t ask permission, just ask forgiveness you know
So uhh
Forgive me
Yeah


Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a vantage you can gain
They love it when you smile
Unaware that it’s a strain
It’s a curse you gotta live with
When you’re born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say you’re the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Terrence in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It’s a weight that’s on my chest
Who ever spottin’ me is playin’
So I’m liftin’ all alone
Trynin’ not to get a sprain
Hopin’ Western Junior doin’ currency exchange

Cuz my dad called
It got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like
I had a rolls and I went and got a range
And he payin’ for his cigarettes
With some dollars and some change
Yeah
And I can only feel his pain
Cuz in Memphis, Tennessee
There is only so much to attain
So I’m fillin’ out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me
I just hope he doesn’t say that shit in vain
I’m why your girls heart is in a slain
Call me Heartbreak Drake
I’m the hardest one to tame
As a man, I’m just honest
As an artist, I’m a king
With my own set of problems
That be sittin’ on my brain
Yeah
And see this is the thang
What they viewin’ as braggin’
Is the way that I maintain
The shit I write
While starin’ out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I remain

Me


Yeah…
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
That’s why I’m putting on
They always wanna ask what type of act that you putting on
Like…. Damn 


Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn’t be driving, it just got so much harder
Can’t even see straight, I can’t even see straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I’m the truth that’s right I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain’t gotta die to get to heaven
You Girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How’d I know, how’d I know? That’s me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you asking me my where-abouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rappin’ bitches, rappin’ bitches bitches
And rappin’ rappin’ an’ bitches until all of us switches
I swear, it’s been two years since somebody ask me who I was
I’m the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
That’s whats important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing “walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I’m a uptown nigga, ah”
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways


People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)


Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon’ tell me that she don’t dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that’s all I’m really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin’ furs like its snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that’s the shit that she like
So why am I a classic, this is who I’m trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turnin’ papers in won’t get me paid
If I don’t nothing I’mma ball
I’m countin all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah I need that, making major changes to the life I’m living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways



People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)

Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do


All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting, I told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

 


Every morning when I wake up, uh, money on my mind
Good times and get caked up, uh, sunshine coming through my blinds
I’m living but, really though, it’s never enough
10 milli on, that's a must, living in California, everybody wanna visit for


Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Yo, it sound clever, come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA


These niggas’ll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck can’t y'all see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It’s a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I’m stressed


You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I’m forever living




My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him - some
3 W’s only for a three day run
Bitch, take them motherfucking panties off, you ain't no - nun, shit
I be living in the sky everytime I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control
California living 'til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know the priority order me Hennessey
And for my niggas OG Killa
Call it Jason Voorhees, boy he's on his job
Boy he sure be having the marks
On they mark, pretty bitches and tire marks
Let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost
For this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh
If I’m wrong then I wanna be right
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it’s not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off




Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, muthafuck your opinion
How many ways am I killing 'em, shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she’ll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I’m in a position of controlling, anything, I buy that ocean
I'm a boss I’ll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this


They want that shit, they often feind
I give it to ‘em, but in between, my time
I gotta tie shoestrings, life’s a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean toward 3 W’s in life
You know blow job need an application, eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like ‘em brown, just like my drink, the fuck you think
I don’t fuck wit’ no hand me downs, see if you fuck then its after me
You know how much I’mma make it work?
You know her dress, slip it in her purse
When you discussed your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first, Cali

 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question: 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two) 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question: 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
Want you look to your left and right, ask you friends 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me? 
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be? 
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime? 
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line? 
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off 
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car 
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K. Lamar 
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog 
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson 
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome 
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing 
But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question: 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And if you riding with me 

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her? 
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur? 
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt? 
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? 
Can you be immortalised without your life being expired? 
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time? 
Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent? 
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending? 
How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness? 
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended 
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing 
What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it's mentioned? 
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson 
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom 
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message 
That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And if you riding with me 

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues 
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you 
That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson 
I went to Robben's Island analysing, that's where his cell is 
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me 
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be? 
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs 
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow 
Murphy's Law, generation X, will I ever be your ex? 
Floss off a baby step, mobbed by the mouth a bit 
Pause, put me under stress 
Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect 
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall 
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead? 
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red? 
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shooter you assassin 
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it's Michael Jackson, oh 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga 

"I remember you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence 
Sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power, full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screaming in the hotel room 
I didn't wanna self destruct 
The evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went running for answers 
Until I came home 
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt 
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one 
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination 
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned 
The word was respect 
Just because you wore a different gang colour than mines 
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man 
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets 
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us 
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another nigga" 

Shit and that's all I wrote 
I was gonna call another nigga but, it ain't really a poem, I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to. Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you, I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground. What you mean ‘bout that, what the ground represent? 

The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil. That's how I see it, my word is bond. I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm saying, wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you know what I'm saying it's gonna be like… there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich 

Aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that's rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities? 

I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin', I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I'm saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying. I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us 

And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? 

By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true. You know what I'm saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying, I was noticing, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it's no problem, you know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know. I'm finna go straight through 

Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? 

I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been threatened with resistance it's been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back 

Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down 

In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. And you don't wanna fight no more. And if you don't believe me you can look around, you don't see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas 

That's crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today? 

Shit, I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be bloodshed for real. I don't think America can know that. I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka. You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen 

That's crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people don't understand how important it is. Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy I'mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes 

Because the spirits, we ain't really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us 

Damn 

I wanted to read one last thing to you. It's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says: 

"The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it 
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city 
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive 
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly 
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar 
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits 
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him 
He can no longer see past his own thoughts 
He's trapped 
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city 
The result? 
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant 
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle 
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same." 

What's your perspective on that? 
Pac, Pac, Pac

When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hoping that you’ll survive
Gather your wind, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

When I get signed, homie I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue eyed devil with a fat ass monkey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game, made a bad bitch yours
When I get signed homie I'mma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican, run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated but I got a million dollar check, like that

We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home

Yo what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keeping it, motherfucker

What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam on your dollar
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliche and say, fuck your haters
I can see the borrow in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies with a snow white collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me feel forever baby, count it all together baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
Too much and enough both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick
And when you get the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

Lookin' down is quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top you got it)
A lot of metaphors, leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'


It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya
See ya picture, now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya


Yeah, one time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch


I'm so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need


I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Air Force stunting flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that muthafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on


I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Takin' everything slow, so slow, so slow but I do it to her


Drapped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end


Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rollin' through the city
Bumpin' that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like everything just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone

(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.)
Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Drawin' a Blank like
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.

Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma do that for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()

Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
Imeet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

Love yours
Love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive
Don't be sleepin' on your level cause its beauty in the struggle nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle nigga
(Let me explain)
It's beauty in the struggle , ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block man we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive

Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer
I came up in the underground though
so I’ma spend another ten thousand for Dilla
call me over rated or creative or too jaded
because any way you put it bitch I made it, YUP




Whoah!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
and like, back and forth because ah
this is.. what you thought it wasn't
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background*
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...


Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smocking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swinging, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman


So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screaming _Fuck the World_ like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck!!
Talking that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck!!


I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Search to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below friezing
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snorting, supporting abortion
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an Afghan




Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screaming like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinning
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfucking style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washing dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smocking weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in




Hey, fuck that!
Outsidaz..
Pace One..
Young Zee..

Ohh ohhh
Oh(yea) oh(yea) oh(yea)
Ohh ohhh
Ohhh

But they don't pave no mind( yooo) (yooo)
(Good night)
Good bye

Your walkin down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the mornin
And your in a
Nightmare
It's HORRIBLE
Right there's the coroner
Waitin for you
To turn the corner
So he can corner ya
Your a goner
He's ona ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
Cause you can't run anymore
Your done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody
Is watchin in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplading my next plot again
Swallowin the Klonopin
While I'm noddin
In and out on the autumn and
If the ramada inn
Holdin onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at mcdonalds
With
Blood all over me
Dead bodies
Behind the counter
SHIT
Guess I must of just blacked out again
NOT AGAIN

It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel
Until I find hannah montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin
Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin
Every candle on top of the fire place
Mantalin
Grab my flannel and my bandana then
Kiss the naked manakin man again
You can see him standin in my
Front window
If you look in
I'm just a hooligan
Who's use to usin hallicinogens
Causin illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Raise the scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules too
Me
What am I gone do
Had the prodical son
The diabolical one
Very methodical
I slaughtered them

It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and

She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I duck and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I
Had that much fun
Off a half pint of the jack
My last vic and a half
A flashlight
Up kim kardashians ass

I remember the first time
I dismembered a family member
December I think it was
I was having drinks with my cuz
And I wrapped him
In christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin tub
Cut him up into pieces
Then just when I went to drink his
Blood
I thought I outta drink this bath water
That outta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me
That might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams
Just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 am
And here I come
So you should probably run
A secret passage way around here
Man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs
It aint no stoppin me from choppin him up(up)

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure


How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9am in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?


Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas lookin' like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowin' that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's gettin' into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lackin' synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it’s meant to be
Paranoid, always rollin' with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

As i fall deeper into a manic state
Im a prime canidate for the gene to recieve the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of night quil then i salivate
Start off with the night quil like i think i'll just have a taste
Couple sips of that then i gradually graduate 
Too a harder perscription drug called valium like ya that's great
I go to take just one and i end up like having eight 
Now i need something in my stomach cuz i haven't ate
Maybe i'll grab a plate of nachos and i'll have a steak
And you'd think with all i have at stake
Look at my daughters face....
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad i think 
He's acting weird again he's really begining to scare me
Wont shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos 
And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat 

( Hook )
Sometimes i feel so alone,
I just dont know ,feels like i been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as i go home and close the door,
kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place i do,
But i cant and i wont say i tried but i know thats a lie cuz i dont
and why i just dont know..... 


( 2 )
Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer 
Thats the devil in my ear i been sober a fuckin year
And that fucker still talks to me he is all i can fuckin hear
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers
And maybe if i just drink half i'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man i got half a mind
Too have another half of glass of wine sound acinine
Ya i know
But i never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch im about to fall
I missed the couch and down i go looking like a bouncing ball
Shit must have knocked me out cuz i aint feel the ground at all
Wow what the fuck happend last night where am i
Man fuck am i hungover and god damn i got a head ache 
Shit half a vicodin why cant i ? 
" All systems ready for take off please stand by "

So i take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh 
A couple weeks go by it aint even like im getting high
now i need it just not to feel sick ya im getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die 
Oh ya theres an excuse you lose proof so you use 
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin you to get through
It's twelve noon aint no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes
now here i am 3 months later full blown relapse
Just get high untill the kids get home from two homes relax
And since im convinced that im in-somniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so i take 3 naps 
Just to be able to function throughout the day lets see 
That's an ambian each nap how many valium 3
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken 4 years just too put out an album b 
See me and you we almost had the same outcome he
Cuz that christmas you know the nomonia thing
It was bolognya was it the methadone ya think 
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos 
your vcr tape cases with you ambian cr great places to hide aint it
So you can lie to hailie im going beddy bye whitney baby good night elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor

Yo, I can't sing it....

I feel like singin'....

I wanna fuckin' sing...

Cuz I'm happy..
Yeah......I'm happy

Ha Ha, I got my baby back...

Yo, check it out 


Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think theres nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry 

Somtimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wasting my time? 

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 


Somtimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me 


My baby girl  keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, cuz they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side 

I act like shit don't phase me,
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive 

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 




Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singing this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mum didn't abort
Now you probly get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his momma,
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Cuz there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul,
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breaking should I just give up,
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself,
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin'hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted are nothing to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': 
3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to peoples backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', why'd I stick my penis up in?
Woulda ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted 

Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cuz my baby know's that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

Gotta do what I gotta do


All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting, I told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

 

I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence 
Sometimes, I did the same 

If these walls could talk

Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway 
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out 
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey 
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play 
And shes plays only when you tell her no 


If these walls could talk 
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you 
If these walls could talk 
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it 

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good 
No boat I float better than he would 
No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth 
But your flood can be misunderstood 
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment 
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension 
Me? I’m just a tenant 
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute 
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation 
Interior pink, color coordinated 
I interrogated every nook and cranny 
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me 
These walls want to cry tears 
These walls happier when I’m here 
These walls never could hold up 
Everytime I come around demolition might crush 

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep 
Yelling at me continuously I can see 
Your defense mechanism is my decision 
Knock these walls down that’s my religion 
Walls feeling like they ready to close in 
I suffocate then catch my second wind 
I resonate in these walls 
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls 
I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in 
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest 
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them 
I’m not involved I’d rather diss them 
I’d rather call all you put your wall up 
Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush 

If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late 
Your destiny accepted your fate 
Burn accessories and stash them where they are 
Take the recipe, the bible and god 
Wall telling you that commissary is low 
Race wars happening no calling CO 
No calling your mother to save you 
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable 
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch 
Walls is telling me you a bitch 
You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them 
That sentence so important 
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me" 
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me 
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life 
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night 
So when you play this song rewind the first verse 
About me abusing my power so you can hurt 
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny 
About me and her in the after hours of the morning 
About her baby daddy currently serving life 
And how she think about you until we meet up at night 
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her 
And how she fucking on a famous rapper 
Walls could talk 

I remember you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence 
Sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screaming in a hotel room

Cole
Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back man
As I do so well

Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngen' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deep and
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said "You ever had sex before"
Damn

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no

I wrote back and said "Of course I had sex before"
Knowing I was frontin'
I said I'm like a pro baby
Knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know that
So she done wrote back and told me
"Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'"
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you laying on the bed
Teacher please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like "Yeah baby sound like a plan"
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned
Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin
Fuck

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no

You know that feelin' when you you finna bone for the first time
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying "God don't let me bust quick"
I'm watching pornos trying to see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in her crib now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
"I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you a pro, but baby be gentle cause"

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no

G-Unit! Haha

()
Cause we came here to set this party off right
let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in thru the front we'll come thru the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without a least sayin' good bye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right scream one last time.

Get your ass up for the Doctor
One more time Get your ass up for the Doctor
come on now, here we go
cliffhanger it's another club banger
got you hangin on the edge of your seat
get on down

Time's up, game's over, you lose i win
bout to show these knuckle heads how to do this here
oooh yeah, new year
next phase begin
look who's got you goin crazy again
i'm a trend, i set one every time i'm in
i go out and just come back in full circle again
if you a fad that means it's something that we already had
but once your gone you don't come back
too bad you're off the map now
radar can't even find you
we stay on the grind
you slip we out grind you
you walk around mad you let your anger blind you
we walk around just playin the violin behind you
enough with all the pissin and moanin, whinin and bitchin
sit observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
why i'm sittin multi-platinum, later 3 diamond worldwide
we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin

(chorus)

When Dr. Dre says "Crunk!"  you will get it crunk (get it crunk, crunk, crunk)
and when 50 Cent says "Jump!" you will get on one foot and jump! (jump, jump, jump)
Applause is tremendous , we drop you all the senses
i don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
we keep the party rockin off the hinges
we ain't showin off we're just goin off popular consensus
but critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all washed up
knock it off! Who the fuck is Doc impressin?
Doc is this, Doc is that
you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cockadock cause Doc left you all guessin
so DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?)
we gonna have this muthafucka hoppin in a second (uh huh)
that's why we always save the best cut last
to make the scratch and mix for it like fresh cut glass
We swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
spoke to an generation of angry teenagers whom if it wasn't for rap
to bridge the gap may be raised to be racists
who may have never got to see our faces
grace the cover of Rollin Stone pages
broke down barriers of language and races
just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
to pass the mic don't need ta play back and forth like 
the hot potato game or somethin

()

50 Cent come on!
Now snap, hands up
you know how we do, we make the club jump everywhere we go
it's no secret, everybody know 
when Dre's involved there's plenty of money involved 
and plenty honeys involved 
it's sunny Sundays and palm trees, Cali
every day is just another party from The Valleys
all the way to the "make my" alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the Grand Finale
now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
blaze a pound of weed 6 days about the week
you can catch me in the studio bangin out the beatsta
provide ya with the heat that keep blazin out the speakers 
so never say never cause Shady Aftermath together along with G-Unit 
records presents the return of the "The Doc" (O'Shay)
no one can do it better we tear that club up and leave without a shred of evidence
and a...

()

yeah! haha Still Aftermath 2006!
And don't worry bout that Detox Album... it's comin! 
We gonna make Dre do it. Ha ha! 
50 Cent  G-Unit




Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!


I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty range I heard that
She wanna go and party, She wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
'less I write it down for real, P.S


You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song


I really hope you play this
Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice, Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.S...




Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve
Every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking poor maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P.S.....




"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, you gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your Grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?"
"Enough with all this talkin"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you out that mother fucker homie" 



Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black, white or a albino yeah
You can have corn rows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go *blah
From outta nowhere, you might find your career
Come to an *err and I'm just like (Oh Yeah)



See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)

See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)



Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let em talk shit, cause they talk shit
Knowing deep down, they really just wanna squash it
Cause no one wants to walk around, stepping in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum'
We just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm
Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiya'
Meanwhile your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
Right in the ass with KY, yes sir!
So full of joy, boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you
'Yea boi don't curr'



See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is G-Unit at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)



Ya homie got clapped on, man I don't care
The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is dogg, man life's not fair
Ya friend should've know not to front round here
Listen kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear
They'll strip yo ass of your jewels, right here
Man I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
Ya girl's a freak, man sometime we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You prolly heard about me, I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin, like I'm running for mayor
riding, winding, dining and shining, know what I'm saying
I ain't got time for fucking around, and horseplaying
I'm making hits, my homies taking hits, who's staying



See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care

It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
Last name ever 
First name greatest 
Like a sprained ankle boy ainâ€™t nothing to play with 
It started off local but thanks to all the haters 
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis 
And your city faded off to brown, Nino 
She insists she got more class, we know 
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo 
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo 
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album 
Whoâ€™d have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome 
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm 
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one 
Yeah nigga Iâ€™m about my business 
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list 
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness 
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness 
Bitches 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
I used to have hood dreams 
Big fame, big chains 
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came 
I went hard all fall like the ball teams 
Just so I can make it rain all spring 
Yâ€™all seen my story my glory 
I had raped the game young 
You can call it statutory 
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me 
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin 
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin 
You would think I ran the world like Michelleâ€™s husband 
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnâ€™t 
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnâ€™t 
Youâ€™re such a fucking loser 
He didnâ€™t even go to class Bueller 
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back 
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack 
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac 
All the way in Hollywood and I canâ€™t even act 
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap 
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
Ok, hello it's da Martian 
Space jam Jordanâ€™s 
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden 
Fresher than the harvest 
Step up to the target 
If I had one guess than I guess Iâ€™m just New Orleans 
And I will never stop like Iâ€™m running from the cops 
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top 
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops 
But what should I scream for this is my theme park 
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark 
Pistol on my side you donâ€™t wanna hear that thing talk 
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention 
Lil Wayne thatâ€™s what they got to say or mention 
Iâ€™m like Nevada in the middle of the summer 
Iâ€™m resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover 
Shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas 
No brake pads, no such thing as last 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
There they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow 
Nuts they go, macadamia they go so ballistic, whoa 
We can make them look like Bosoâ€™s 
Heâ€™s wondering if he should spit this slow 
Fuck no! Go for broke 
His cup just runneth over, oh no 
He ainâ€™t had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed 
Theyâ€™ve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose 
Back into the game and they know 
Rap will never be the same as before 
Bashing in the brains of these hoes 
And establishing a name as he goes 
The passion and the flame is ignited 
You canâ€™t put it out once we light it 
This shit is exactly what the fuck that Iâ€™m talking about when we riot 
You dealinâ€™ with a few true villains 
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillinâ€™ 
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths 
Now rewind it! 
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me, so howâ€™s it taste? 
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place 
Iâ€™m Hannibal Lecter so just in case youâ€™re thinking of saving face 
You ainâ€™t gonna have no face to save by the time Iâ€™m through with this place 
So Drakeâ€¦ 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man

byy: chelsey baybayy!!


Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to pick it
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch


Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long


We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) shake your body


Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khaki's pressed, Nike shoes just crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made Em just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in dang, bang bang
Yes sir Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang dang
P-p-p-pow chicka pow chicka wow wow
Got your gal blowin' up a val-v-v-v-val-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now hoe




We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) get your vials




And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard, drugs are though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you a loan, car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers, shit head with a potty mouth
Get the bar soap lathered, Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl you’re fixin' to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd man
You birdbrain baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you’re a swallow
Word, Rick word man you heard, but don’t be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam





Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish
Hit this house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know its vacant, ya bish
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherene then went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Parked the car and then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel


Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 at the school
You know big ballin with my homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality we poor, ya bish
Another casualty at war, ya bish
Two bullets in my uncle tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish
That Louie's Burger never be the same
A louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin'
Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hoping all of em offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gone crash it when nobodies home


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel


Be the last one out to get this dough? , No Way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes?, No Way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No Way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No Way


Imagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, everyday I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em, get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel



Hol it, Hol it, Hol it, Hol it, Hol it
Y'all sleepin' in the streets
Shaky warrior
Yeah, this that Oliver 40, Niko shit man, 15 Fort York shit ya know
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?

Yeah, yeah
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari then I swerve
I want that Bugatti just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me I guess I know myself
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that
My city too turnt up I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbraud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
That's when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man I'm talkin' way before hashtags

I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go

Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up in here got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie
Yeah, and you know how that shit go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go

She know it, it a no big
Always haffi look out an ya know if yuh head buk out
Dun know, a de unruly boss, dis man
No bomboclat, otha
And if a boy nuh like
OVO crew my nigga can just suck ya motha
With no apology, If you nuh like we, we nuh like you neither youth
Your girl a say we cute, if you diss you will get execute
That's the truth, OVO unruly

(machine gun shots)

With my woes


Fuck dat
8 doobies to the face
Fuck dat
12 bottles in the case
Nigga, fuck dat
2 pills and a half, wait
Nigga, fuck dat
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist


Man, I swear
My nigga trippin off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him vicodin
Hope to take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of section 8
And you feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are
A loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins
Make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin off
My generation sippin cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition
That the world is bout to end
Who gives a fuck? we never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
A melody and some hoes
Playstation and some drank
Technology bumping Soul
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd, that's product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black
She black too
Purple label on her back
But that dap
Is like when she take it straight to the head
Then she look at me
She got AD-HD




Like woah oh oh woah (x4)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(They always told me ad-hd did it)


And then she started
And then she started
Feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
Beg you pardon
Oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23
Ok then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said where my drink at?
I'mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors
Have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds
Closed the screen, jumbotron
Made it to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it
Then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That ADHD crazy






You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six
Just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, dro, hoes
Whatever you like
You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light


You still love me?
Take this. 
You ready? 1.. 2.. 3! 


The more you, put me through,
The more it makes me wanna come back to you,
You say you hate me, I just love you more,
You don't want me, I just want you more,
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
I know it's sad but it's making me happy,
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
Cause you love me, and I love you more.


It's sick, but who could ever predict,
We'd be doin' the same shit,
We say we do it for our baby but we don't,
We do it for us, it's lust,
Cause neither one of us trusts each other,
So we fuck 'til we bust,
Then we cuss each other, out,
We know what it's about,
Shout 'til I throw you out the house,
You throw me out the house,
I throw you on the couch,
Punch you in the mouth,
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,
And apologize after,
Laughter, pain, it's insane,
We're back in the same chapter again,
And it's sad but it's true,
When I'm layin' here with you,
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.




Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,
It makes me wanna just take you,
And just throw you on the bed,
And fuck you like I don't even know you,
You fuck other people, and I fuck other people,
You a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,
We're both evil in our ways,
But neither one of us would ever admit it,
Cause one of us would have one up on the other,
So forget it,
We can make accusations, people spread rumors,
But they ain't got proof,
'Til they do it's just the two of us,
It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me,
But you gotta believe me to a degree,
Cause true indeed if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,
Yeah I would cause the sex is too damn good,
If I ran who would I run to,
That would be this soft and warm,
So it's off and on, usually more off than on,
But at least we know that we share this common bond,
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on,
I hope, the only reason that I cope,
Is cause of that fact,
And plus I can bust in that,
And that's why...




I could never understand it,
That's why I don't try,
From junior high until we both die,
It's silly ho why must we try,
Is it really so rough,
That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,
Try to pull each other's legs,
Until the other begs,
We're liein' to ourselves,
That's the beauty of it yeah,
Cause we truly love each other,
That's why we always fight,
And all we do is shove each other,
Every other fuckin' night,
And it's clear it ain't gonna change,
It's pent up rage,
We both have,
We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,
We've both been,
Someone else's someone else,
Problem is neither one wants help,
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed,
Our family's mixed up,
There's a baby sister in the mix,
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,
On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,
All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,
But I won't be made a fool of,
If this is true love,
You wouldn't do what,
You did last time,
You wouldn't screw up,
This time,
Cause this time girl,
I'm telling you what,
You do it again I'm fucking you up,
No matter what...


What you say, what you do,
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,
No matter where you run, I'll be right there,
Right behind you, in your nightmares,
All the flowers, and the candy,
All the times that you threw it back at me,
You told me you hate me, you're gonna hate me more,
When you find out, can't escape me whore.



You know a lotta girls be...thinking my songs about them, but
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...


Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say you da fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate,
Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the matt and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

Cause,



Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffin theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 

Uhh, ah yea
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money
You know who you are, I got ya

Ay yo DJ respect let’s get em
Veterans like how dare all of this arrogance
What you expect when all they do draw comparisons between us and Americans
And tell me go hard well I am going harder now 
Bumping Shawn Carter cause there aint a Shawn Carter now feel me
Get with it I’m trying to overthrow a nation using Phade To Black as a niggas only motivation
I’m picking and choosing an army and thinking of moving my talent disprove it
Let’s show her heads who’s in
And if you must know this year I’m going for the gusto plus though seat feeling like a bus load
So take me as I am I have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that parade love me
I’m a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for trinity Chris word
See my role models role with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough then the whole lotto
 So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mamoses with the clique quad
What up Nikko Jordan Lucky and TJ nicknamed the night fox clique we take it easy
You prime ministers claim you repping the team I need a mother fucking president to represent me

Just the two of us.. 


Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world

Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin

Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water

A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)

But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just me and you baby
is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby

So this is it?
This is what I wished for
This isnt how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just this shit'd be different
But something changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffing it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldnt quit
I just wanted a little bit
Them it turned me to a monster 
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert
I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sowing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no one for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in between
You either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3 years later they go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just aint pass yet
A couple more years that shit'll be illmatic 
And 8 years later I'm still at it
Divorced, remarried
A felon,a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk


So be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold
I said be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might ot know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold

I got a letter from a fan that said
He's been praying for me
Everyday, and for some reason it's been weighing on my mind heavy
Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But some thing told me to go ahead and open it but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you
You didn't pray for me when i was local
And as i lay these vocals
I think of all the shit i had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you atleast a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but i've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride hasn't it?
Just watching it from an opposite stand point
Man boy's got to look... nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now on how
To describe this shit
It's just like  a vibe you get
Go ahead  and bop to it just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit

Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who"
And she like, "who are we kidding? You're 27, you just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me ,momma
What more they want from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough
Ir making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Come on hey hey we goin' to the beach 
grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat. 
Where's Mama? 
She's takin' a little nap in the trunk 
Oh that smell dada must have run over a skunk. 
now I know what you're thinkin': 
it's kind of late to go swimmin' 
but you know your mama she's one of those types of women 
who does crazy things and if she don't get her way she'll throw a 
fit 
don't play with daddy's toy knife, honey, let go of it 
and don't be so upset, why you actin' bashful? 
don't you wanna help dadda build a sand castle? 
and mama said she wants to show how far she can float, 
and don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat 
it's just a little scratch it don't hurt, 
her was eatin' dinner while you was sleepin' and spilled ketchup on 
her shirt 
mama's messy, isn't she, we'll let her wash off in the water 
and me and you can play by ourselves, can't we? 
just the two of us (sung) repeat 8-9 times 
there's a place called heaven and a place called hell, 
a place called prison and a place called jail, 
and dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one, 
'cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson 

and you don't want a brother do ya? (Na) 
maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better, I'll 
explain it to ya. 
but for now we'll just say that mama was real, real bad 
she was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad 
but I still feel sad that I put her in time out, 
sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin' to climb out 
I told you it's okay, hey hey, wanna baba? 
take a night-night, nana-boo, goo-goo ga-ga 
humma goo-goo caca, dad'll change your dighty, 
clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty. 
you're dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water, 
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter. 
just the two of us (sung) 
wake up sleepy head we're here, 
before we play, we're gonna take mama for a little walk along the 
pier. 
baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea, 
mama's too sleepy to hear you screamin' in her ear, 
that's why you can't get her to wake, 
but don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mama at the bottom of the 
lake, 
here, you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock? 
we'll tie it to her footsies then will roll her off the dock. 
ready now, here we go, on the count of three, 
one, two, three...weeeeeeeeee 
there goes mama splashin' in the water, 
no more fightin' your dad, no more restrainin' order, 
no more step dada, no more new brother, 
blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her, 
we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk, 
but first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk, 
just the two of us (sung)


Things been so crazy and hected
I should of have got back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better any how...


So if you gotta go
If there's anythin I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you looking for a purpose


You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm all singing karaoke, further than I ever been


So if you gotta go...
If there's anyway I can help


Isn't it ironic,
That the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
And tell's me my life is to much and moves to atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you would choose some where that had somebody that you know
I'm alway's up to late
I worry bout you there alone in a place you call your home warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy cause no man wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest but the first cut is the deepest
I tryed to keep us together you was busy keeping secrets
Secrets you would tell everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money
I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm suprise you couldn't tell


I was only trying to get ahead 
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And your looking for a purpose


I was only trying to get ahead 
But the spotlight makes you nervous...

Fuck it,
Ay,
Do or Die, new arrival,
Holla at my niggas,
You survive you's alive, yo,
Now either you follow me and ride, or you's a rival.
The difference between you and I is you a model, you posing.
But who am I though?
The mulatto out for that lotto,
Money coming soon, the newest model,
Your crew is hollow,
The type of niggas got more dick, chew and swallow.
Your girl told me shoot in her face, she suicidal,
Oh shucks, you niggas is closed, you fold up.
I'm from the Ville, niggas get killed over four bucks,
Thank God we made it, my niggas, we grown up,
Now we crazy over that bread, call us the "dough-nuts," uh,
More sluts once the money blows up,
But them hoes stop if the dough drops,
I won't stop though, a chip off the 'ol block.
I'm from a city where niggas hole blocks,
Leave you looking like old socks, damn,
Cops patrol blocks, spotting on us,
The boys is rotten, I know they want us,
Probably arrest a nigga, get a bonus,
You kill a nigga, get promoted,

Shit is crazy, girls getting babies before they get diplomas,
So much I just go nuts,
Niggas telling me slow up,
Remember that,
I'm tryna get where that cheddar at,
Y'all don't hear me,
Always somebody that don't want you getting cheese, yo,
This whole bullshit is like Tom and Jerry,
I'm kinda very raw, niggas can't deny facts,
If you black they sending you to jail or Iraq,
Honor is something you can't sell or buy back,
Niggas don't like bragging, they 9-11 fly cats,
Hijack niggas, "Get up out your whip nigga, strip!
I want it all- ice on your wrists and the kicks,"
This shit happens, I ain't just rapping, believe it yo,
They got streets in the city police won't even go,
Peep it though, uh,
It ain't no secret, niggas beefing cause my ego so big,
It got me speaking like I'm diesel, like I'm devil, oh,
Niggas know my stylo, I ain't tweaking, I am lethal though,
Have your daddy looking for you,
This ain't Finding Nemo though.
Let me slow it down, dumb it down, y'all warned,
The son came up out that womb, yo, a star is born.
If real recognize real, y'all are foreign,
My team run a play on your bitch and we all scoring, yea!


Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause


They loving the crew


Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'mma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know




Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
(If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city)
TRACK 4 ON TAKE CARE

 ()
This sh-t was all I knew,
you and me only,
and I did it all for you,
still you were lonely,
we coulda worked it out,

uhh, but i guess things change,
its funny how someone elses success brings pain,
when ya no longer involved that person has it all,
and you just stuck standing there,

But, Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,
Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,


Yeah,
ever since Ive been long gone,
I traded in my senorita for a microphone,
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see,
your life is good but me and you its catastrophe,
if I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied,
I need a paramedic girl, Im feeling paralysed,
if I could choose, you will always be a friend to me,
the more money I made you acting like my enemy,
its crazy, I cant help it if you feel ashamed,
lots of pressure will turn you into my diamond babe,
how can something so familiar be so strange,
closest friends get estranged when the status change,
ahh, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at,
and my whole wild is the only one that had my back,
you were the perfect girl, now it seems we dont match,
is it the money, want me to give it back,




Uhh, i am the topic of conversation, this a celebration,
lets toast to the fact that I moved out my momma basement,
to a condo downtown because its all about location,
I sit and drink wine and watch californication of life,
you shoulda been here to kick it with me,
we coulda split this whole thing up 50/50,
but now im at the 40/40 getting b-tches tipsy,
killing sh-t the ever so talented Mr Ripley,
how I go from being the man that you argue with,
to me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest sh-t,
I should wanna go back to the one I started with,
but Im addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit,
yeah, just ask me how things are coming along,
you can tell me that you never heard none of my songs,
long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen,
cos whats a star when its most important fan is missing?

()

And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter
It don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter)
You'll see in the end

I've got a feeling that there's somethin' more
Something that holds us together
Something that holds us together
The strangest feeling but I can't be sure
Something that's old is forever
Something that's old is forever
Love
Love
Love
Love

And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter
It don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter)
You'll see in the end

My name is drizzy
and i aint perfect
but i work hard
so i deserve it
and i belong
right where you see me
aint no offence about it
i aint mistah feeny
nah i got a decent set of manners
and a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
and i fall in love with girls caught up with superficial glamour
who dress like sarah jessica
and live like princess diana
so often they have addictions
and im the one that'll feed it
but truely you're bad enough that you dont even really need it
you can show up at the party on dirty public transit
and i guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin candids
of you and your posse partying
drinking watch you get handed
with your virgin island tans
all lookin like you just landed
i dont really understand it
im not sure im comprehending it
but these girls are having fun with whoevas money they spendin

 x2
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be Unstoppable
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie


My name is weezy
Im almost perfect
and i work harder than hard workin
bizzare circus
thats where my bar surface
therefore i act a clown
even when im laying on my back
im never backin down
so overstand me
i got a condo in miami
and my doorman is always sandy
and i run louisiana
but ive never pulled a hammy
and i got a condo in atlanta
and i always wear a bandana
and when it comes down to stuntin
you boys is just buttonin
im swinging for the fence
your girl hanging from my dick
your girl sanging too much shit
like ah loli loli pop

I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
ey ey ey ey

When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)


I know way too many people here right now that I didn’t know last year
who the fuck are y’all
I swear it feels like the last few nights we’ve been everywhere and back
but I just can’t remember it all
what am I doing, what am I doing
oh yeah that's right, I’m doing me, I’m doing me
I’m living life right now man
and this what I’m do til its over
til it’s over, it’s far from over


alright, bottles on me
long as I’m a drink it
never drop the ball, fuck y’all thinking
making sure the young money ship is never sinking
bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldn’t have drove, tell me how I’m getting home
you too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I’ve ever known
got to go thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
all I need is a fucking red jackets with some zippers
super good smiddoke a package of the swishas
I did it over night, it couldn’t happen any quicker
y’all know them, but fuck it me either
but point the biggest skeptic out I’ll make them a believer
it wouldn’t be the first time I’ve done it throwing hundreds
when I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ahh,




Uhhh,
one thing 'bout music when it hits you feel no pain
and I swear I got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
so they tell me that they love me I know better than that it’s just game
it’s just what comes with the flame
and I’m ready for that I’m just saying
but I really can’t complain, everything is kosher
two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
I really can’t see the end getting any closer
but I’ll probably still be the man when everything is over
so I’m riding through the city with my high beams on
can you see me can you see me get your visine on
y’all just do not fit the picture
turn your widespread on
if you thinking Imma quit before I die dream on
man they treat me like a legend
am I really this cold
I’m really too young to be felling this old
it’s about time you admit it who you kidding man
nobody’s ever done it like I did it
ahh
(chorus)

Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again
Soon as you get in




Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah.


I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far


I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
"Cleaning Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause, Ma,
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to Chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away it drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old,
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but




'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for "Cleaning Out My Closet", at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though,
'cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own,
But now the medications taken over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have,
'cause one thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths,
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest,
I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my mama...




I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girl
So I never say, "Goodbye, cruel world."
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die



I want a new life 

(Sing about me)


When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em"
I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'm a push it, wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope -


Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it section.80, the message resemble Brenda's Got a Baby
What's crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'm a need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that "Sorry for your loss shit"
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'm a get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...


When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the cent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help me mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm sure not why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'm a rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that put me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "it need to be told
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her soul"
Exactly would have happened if I hadn't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?


Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me



(Dying of Thirst)

Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't?
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently
But they couldn't, bring her back
Who got the footage? channel 9
Cameras looking, it's hard to channel your energy
When you know you're crooked
Banana clip split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams of ballin like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst

What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world, " my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling
Backwards my mama say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"





Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And I think it's changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture, the trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagle's, an Aries coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
(Real talk) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ride around his block
All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
Welcome to Detroit, mothafucka

Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D
On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas say
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
And to think y'all hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
I had K's in front ya school, but I ain't go to Kettering
Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son
And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody

Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit

And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me
I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch
180 degrees in here trying to wait for the cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah when it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
Sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it
It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters when you came here?
And I came to kill 'em

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

What up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody
Hey Em let me get that instrumental
Take it down to the hood
Let the little hoodies get this remix crackin'
Detroit

I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks
Hit me when you done your shift
Wooh, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what?
I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky
I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me
Someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-the-strippin-shit"
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me
I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect
She's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog

Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift
I need some company
I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company

Mo City trip! Mo City trip right now!
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
A Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now

It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
Tour 'round the city, it's the shit right now
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Pop a couple percs let's get it in right now
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now
Call up your girl and put them heels on
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now
I'm on a Mo City trip
I'm a dog
I'ma dog, I'm in heat baby...heat baby
I'm a dog.....
I go ham, I'm a hog
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off
What she get in to, when we take it off
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions
Do you mind if we just menage just a little?

Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now

Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me girl why you be stressin me for time
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cuz niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me girl why you be stressin me for time
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

My inhibitions, fighting my intuition
Premature premonition
Showin me the demoliton of these phony niggas
So ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime
And checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me! BLAOOOW

Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me girl why you be stressin me for time
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a King
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

Listen
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem, and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gone snatch the crown
Look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds, one verse at a time
And claim too sick. And fuck it, if the shoe fits
Who's the king?

We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
But in reality he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize
The fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same
Are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
Cause deep down I know every poet just wanna be loved

Just the two of us.. 


Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Just the two of us.. 


Just me and you baby
is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby


Hi! My name is.. (what?) My name is.. (who?)
My name is..  Slim Shady
Hi! My name is.. (huh?) My name is.. (what?)
My name is..  Slim Shady

Ahem.. excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?


Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Ummmm..)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh! "So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!




My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Owwwwwwww!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians
In a space ship while they screaming at me: "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans (Aaahhhhhh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!'




Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive (Huh yup!)
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? (WAH!)
YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS! (WAHHH!)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (BANG!)
I'm steaming mad (Arrrggghhh!)
And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had






We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!


Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here


Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth
Cuz the people that hurt can’t understand it
You speakin outlandish, I’m ashamed how to make it all work
Another planet, it’s a short term role for me
I rec it’s all for me, it’s just mo with me
And you’re here for you too here can re-persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin off, I ain’t takin off these pistons
I’m takin off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much it’d cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a shortterm goal, no sky is the limit
I’m past that, now pass that
A word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours


I see myself performing at
Soldout shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammys, winning 5 awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Can’t imagine how it feels
That’s why I’m smiling every day
Cause my dream ain’t far away


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


You’re looking at me and tell me I’m blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I’m at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, I’m reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I’m a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow I’mma take that I’ll never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I root
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin to you, I was walkin it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello


And I’m so happy I cry
Cause I can’t believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it’s so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you play so hard
And you’ve come so far
And you go, that is the time for you to leave your more
And I’m gonna do it
Watch me


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better

Lyrics © Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group

Study long, study wrong, nigga 
Hey, y'all close that front door, ya'll let flies in this motherfucker 
Close that door! 
My OG up in this motherfucker right now 
My pops man with the bottle in his hand, actin' a fool 
Hey, hey, babe check it out, Imma tell you what my mama had said, she like: 

I could spot you a mile away 
I could see your insecurities written all on your face 
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say 
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang 
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same 
Circus acts only attract those that entertain 
Small talk, we know that it's all talk 
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name 

Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me 
Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me 
Say you got to burn your stash to impress me 
It's all in your head, homie 
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me 
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me 
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me 
You sound like the feds, homie 

You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie 
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
You ain't gotta try so hard 

And the world don't respect you and the culture don't accept you 
But you think it's all love 
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done 
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one 
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex) 
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex) 
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex 
Let me put it back in proper context 

What do you got to offer? 
Tell me before you we off ya, put you deep in the coffin 
Been allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit 
Instead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is 
Niggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie 
This is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts 
You can never persuade me 
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them 
Or you, the truth you love to bend 
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho 
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though 
So loud, rich niggas got low money 
And loud, broke niggas got no money 
The irony behind it is so funny 
And I seen it all this past year 
Pass on some advice we feel



I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
I faced her around
But his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His bridges, he out grow'd em


Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand,
Someone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm, you prick
You call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder
You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me
See he's in a whole nother weight class
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets
You're full of it; you were just in his CD's
Left at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E

I'm haunted I'm dead your gone

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oooooh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it 

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe

Look inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt and never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don’t know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


I’m trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I’m looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I’ll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


You ain’t heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don’t you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3′s in the air I can see you are – in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I’ll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it’s alive
My new year’s resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say – Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe

The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either crip or piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and,.. real talk, and


This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, y'know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hold up
Where you from? "How-bang"
Where you stay? "Westside", that's a piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed to cross Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the hot ninety-five, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but


This is why they fuck with me (I told you nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, y'know?


This is why they fuck with me 
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

So there you have it
But I'm a leave you with this
An OG once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I'm gone

Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
Some shit about a message you left 
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" 
This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! 
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre 
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way) 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch 

So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
We can fly over the border "Let's go" 
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
 (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri 
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste 
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Plus he raps with his regular voice 
 (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys 
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ 
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! 
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
Do somethin'! At least one punchline 
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs 
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither 
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!) 
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', ain't no tellin'

Suitcase, I been livin' out a suitcase
Still drinkin' Henny, if it's done, I'll take the D'usse
Oops, aye, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
True say, I been goin' hard, but then again
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in, man
I got a blunt, can I get a light?
Yeah, I took the summer off to get it right
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Niggas like "you took the summer off? we couldn't tell"
Dawg, just bought a island, gotta sail to it
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it somebody gotta do it
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it

Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
The shit was gettin' too predictable
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah
I mean we hear about the money you been gettin'
We just never seen a visual
It's our year (aw yeah), Aw yeah
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)
What's the word these days?
Buncha' niggas chasing after all these woman they don't even know (WOOO)
Buncha' out of season woman
Fuckin' off-season niggas to get last season wardrobe (WOOO)
All the rappers that you vouch for
Need to get out of the house more, they washed up
And even if the team was religious with it
I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, naw (WOOO)

OVO, Unruly
One shot to make it in a life
From the six to the fucking 876

I gotta keep watchin' for oppers 'case anything's possible, yeah
There's no code or ethics out here, anyone will take shots at you, yeah
Niggas think they can come take what I got, let's be logical, yeah
V-Live, I order that Alfredo pasta then eat in the kitchen like i'm in the mafia
Houston, they get me though
European, my vehicle
How much it hit me fo'?
Ain't no tellin', yeah
What am I willin' to give her to get what I want tonight?
Ain't no tellin'
Please don't speak to me like I'm that Drake from four years ago
I'm at a higher place
Thinkin' they lions and tigers and bears, I go huntin'
Put heads on my fire place, oh my
Take time, ain't no tellin'
Oh my, ain't no tellin'

The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
And turned to the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossin' the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts and get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights, cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me cause I love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide
It's just physics, please let's put our egos aside
You my niggas, and should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said son
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track

Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God
Nigga Cole the God
January 28th 

Drake]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got sh*t on what you're feeling now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man
Yeah I said it, B*tch I'm the man
Don't you forget it

The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in the speaker right now: that's me
And the voice in the mirror, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted, with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason that you always getting faded

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me

Ok look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things

It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of "Mr Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me


May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you
And heaven accept you..

Ooww Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you’ve all been waiting for ..
In this corner : weighing 175 pounds,
with a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,
the undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world :
Slim Shady!

 : Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don’t act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh Uh-oh, bitch3s hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where’s the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I notice there’s so many of them
and there’s really not that many of us.
And ladies love us, my posse’s kicking up dust.
It’s on till the break of dawn
and we’re starting this party from dusk

Ok … let’s go

Eminem
Back wit Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you’ll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the fumunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
Its a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed.
Bitch3s lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us. Its ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the sh-t
gets worse then worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
Its elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say we're the center of attention its true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here’s the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio’s back on you hoes.

 : Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don’t act like a snobby model.
You just hit the lotto.

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

Dr Dre
They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain’t got to tell me why you’re sick cuz I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.
I’m an itch that they cant scratch, they sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cuz over and above all, its just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I’ll be dammed, just f*cked around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end
Lets cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know.
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision.
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

Nigga on and on till the break of what

Fat ass burgundy bags classy sh-t Jimmy Cho shoes
I say move a bitch move

{verse 1}
all niqht i've, been starin'
can you tell i want you ?
can't be too, wide open
but there's nothin, i won't do
ohhh... just want  you to know

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

{verse 2}
I wish i... wasn't famous
I wish i... was still in school
So that i can have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you crazy

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious


{fadey fade away.... lls .}


Yesterday when we were getting high
you were invited, you woulda liked it
uh uh ah, I know you all too well
we said that we can kiss the past goodbye
but your weren't excited
there's no way to fight it
you can stay shawty but here I go


Should I spend the weekend in Vegas
I'm busy living the moment not taking pictures to save it
I mean how could I forget
my memories never faded I can't relate to these haters
my enemies never made it
I am... still here with who I started with
the game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr sh-t
carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship
yeah, I'm 23 with a money tree
growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist and thats how she met my pops
and now my garden is enormous, it's happening penny lane
I said its happening Penny Lane
just like you said I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead
uh ahh, thats word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough!


What am I afraid of
this is what dreams are supposed to made of
the people I don't have time to hang with
always look at me and say the same sh-t

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh



Am I wrong for making light of my situation
clap on when 40 got something for me to snap on
NOw that I'm on I dont want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on
get my f-cking buffett on
I heard they jsut moved my grandmother to a nursing home
and I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
but hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
that I barely know at all and
plus this women that I mess with unprotected txt us saying she wish she woulda kept it
the one I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
I couldn't tell you where the f-ck head is
I'm holding on by a thread its like I'm high right now
the guy right now and you can tell by looking at my eyes right now
that nothing really comes as a surprise right now
cause we having the time of our lives right now




I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
the other day Lissa told me she missed the old me
which made me question when I went missing
and when I start treating my friends different
maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the 2 guns in my face during the stick up
maybe cause I girl I f-cking trusted set the whole sh-t up
but a fact I have'nt seen 'em since they locked big Rich up
I know, the same time, I'm quick to forget
bout to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets
burn it al burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
cause half the itme I got it right I probably guessed
did I just trade free time for camera time
will I blow all of this money baby, hammertime
yeah, I just need some closure, aint no turning back for me
I'm in it till it's over



It's Young Money Baby
I got something for these niggas to ride to
Fa'sho
Here I go


Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now,
Su-woop to the bangers,
Su-woop to the bangers, (yeah)

I be on some G shit
Check out what I done, and
Check out who I be with
I'm me bitch, I said I'm me bitch

Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG




Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love,
Cause I don't have the time for that
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where it's at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract

I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggaz for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch

And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG




I a'int have sex in a long time 
Are we havin is sex tonight?
Ladies say, I ain't have sex in a long time
I a'int have sex in a long ass time
Baby, I ain't have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight, sex tonight

Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100 nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

Real quick, whole squad on that real shit

Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'

Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

 Hailie

 Come here baby

 Okay

I'm about to get rid of some hoes it's simple
I put the Murder Inc with lead and I'm not talking about a pencil
Look at what the fuck you dun got into
I see you found your nitch you're just a bitch with a menstral
Claiming you a murderer and spelt it wrong
You put the "E" before the "D" because that's all you on
You on Pac's dick (bitch) you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins 3 deals that another nigga got you they didn't see

And I ain't playing your a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be praying on his cover cause he need it
And you niggas hating shut your mouths
It's just the real niggas ain't buying that shit you put out


Doe Rae Me but we don't sing motherfuckers
So Murder Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team who expects nothing less then R 'n' B coming from that regime
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream
Now that you embrace the green don't fuck with the triple beams
You're a motherfucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen?
Artists with repituares saw him in action, Pac's assassination
Def jam grabbed him, told him reenact him you'll go platinum
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins
Reenacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in Detroit motherfucker

Doe Rae Me cause we're hot and you're not
Going at me is the only shot you got
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
You can get popped after all that shit you talk


Now we can skip past the mean mugs, get to the slugs
To grievance and the crying and intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga you shook,
You're half of a half-way crook nigga get off X dick go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one and when your gone you'll only be the late fake
one
Nigga please stick the script before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch, fucking old ass ignorant innocent looking senior citizen
Built up slap you like renaissance sicitive wait a minute hold on
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch made man now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holla and curse and go ahead and respond
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse


Slim set an impulse to get at the wanktas
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the drama for stucky and bush stones
What's wrong? didn't think were strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
This real witness you all ain't caught the concept
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source
Threatening at the boss you're gonna see me on your porch
Now I've got the nerve to try serve on us
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust


Do I gotta get my nigga bugs, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Caddillac, Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat
You not Pac's songs without laws will help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your "mock"avelli get your own identity


Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da
(Don't EVER say my little girls name in a song again)
Don't play me cause you're washed up, lost your spot

Obie Trice, D12, G-Unit, 50 Cent, Hailie Jade Hahahaha

 Daddy is Ja Rule taller than me?

 No honey you guys are the same size

Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it wrenched
But now I see my nigga
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah can I get a glimpse?

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Keep on blamin' nigga that ain't never had things
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shits not always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know
How could you know? How could you know?

Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And thats the key my nigga
Listen up I'm bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in the fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, thats what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you nigga

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not, last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Father forgive me for me, childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me, miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but
Before you go I've got to, warn you now
Whatever goes up surely, must come down
And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command


Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great then I falls, my insides crawl
and I clam up (wham) I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road


I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road


I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, and the same pants
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road




You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't the skillest
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each on of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road



I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous a**
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your a**
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that s*** you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light


Fuck dat
8 doobies to the face
Fuck dat
12 bottles in the case
Nigga, fuck dat
2 pills and a half, wait
Nigga, fuck dat
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist


Man, I swear
My nigga trippin off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him vicodin
Hope to take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of section 8
And you feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are
A loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins
Make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin off
My generation sippin cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition
That the world is bout to end
Who gives a fuck? we never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
A melody and some hoes
Playstation and some drank
Technology bumping Soul
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd, that's product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black
She black too
Purple label on her back
But that dap
Is like when she take it straight to the head
Then she look at me
She got AD-HD




Like woah oh oh woah (x4)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(They always told me ad-hd did it)


And then she started
And then she started
Feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
Beg you pardon
Oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23
Ok then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said where my drink at?
I'mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors
Have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds
Closed the screen, jumbotron
Made it to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it
Then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That ADHD crazy






You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six
Just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, dro, hoes
Whatever you like
You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light


I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25 sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?


One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt?
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

 

Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your motherfucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?, cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6

 1:
Aiyyo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, cause they be actin maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming pills or roaches, we sprayed and disinfects
and twist the necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass in a track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
I'm Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

 2:
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, some fruit to stomp,and then two feet to rinse
I greet intensive ladies, I spoil all your fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the only one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My a capella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

 3:
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility 
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tractical, tactful, track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
I'm Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite(x2)

What money got to do with it 
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image? 
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it 
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit 
Hol' up 
Get it back 
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it 
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what? 

If I was the president 
I'd pay my mama's rent 
Free my homies and them 
Bulletproof my Chevy doors 
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord 
Who ever thought? 
Master take the chains off me 

Life can be like a box of chocolate 
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious 
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it 
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive 
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics 
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant 
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious 
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges 
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is 
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it 
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this 
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal 
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god 
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged 
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards 
You lookin' at artists like the harvests 
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them 
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry 
I should've listened what my grandmama said to me 

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga 
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass 
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga 
Oh now, slow down 

And once upon a time in a city so divine 
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid 
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said 

What I'm s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks? 
The convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips 
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor 
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for 
Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this? 
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist 
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it 
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds? 
No more livin' poor, meet my .44 
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor 
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers 
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey 
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay 
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA 
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor? 
Well that's me at these awards 
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy 
She said... 

And once upon a time in a city so divine 
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused 
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse 
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie 
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey 
Hollywood's nervous 
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service

Like we always do it this time
- (Kanye)

Find it 20 mataran dutty whine it whine it
Nicki on a pit while I sign it
How these n-ggas so one-track minded
But really really I don’t give a F-U-C-K
Forget barbie f-ck Nicki cause she’s fake
She’s on a diet but her pockets eating cheese cake
And I’ll say Bride of Chucky is Child’s play
Just killed another career it’s a mild day
Besides ‘Yay they can’t stand besides me
I think me, you and him should minaj friday
Pa-pa-pa-pink wig thick ass give em whip lash
I thi-thi-thi-think big get cash make em blink fast
Now-now-now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaahhhh, I’m a muthaf-cking monster!


I-I crossed the line-line
And I’ll-I’ll let God decide-cide
I-I wouldn’t last these shows
So I-I am headed home


I-I crossed the line-line
And I’ll-I’ll let God decide-cide

So I-I am headed home

You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you're the f-cking coldest
Intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

Well aren't you a breath of fresh air
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they aint got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking somes d-cks until some millions appear
Voila! you do it right he might just buy you a car
Unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre
Independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer
Make it rain finger (check)
M3 beamer (check)
Champagne range
Triple white Caddy
Closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and BeBe
Ya don't need it greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who f-ck for bowls of baked ziti

Uh, 5 and a half in boys
Ass is off the hook
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never
But never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever
You just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas
And enough money to loan us a little something extra
Should we ever need it
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it

Need y'all niggas to feel me yo,
Feel my pain...
Said soft niggas can't last hard times yo,
Believe that shit.
Real niggas don't cry...
Look,
Yo...

Was just a youngin' with that fresh fade,
Bird chest, legs skinny,
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny,
Fresh pennies on my feet,
Momma paid for everything I'm wearing,
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world.
Aw. nigga, but shit done changed since "Mayne" was my nickname,
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game,
Now I'm a man worried about my fam'
Let me explain,
Its like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shits sprained.
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle,
Feeling like the world's on your back so you stumble,
And it feels like a quarterback get sacked, and then you fumble.
Jobs don't call a nigga back so it's back to the hustle.
Niggas praying for they moms,
At the same time they moms pray for them.
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way,
But damn a nigga been a lost fate.
It hurts on the usual,
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral.

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.

I sit back and watch the news every now and then,
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash,
Even the weathers bad.
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted,
Like damn it's '06 and niggas still up on that gang shit?
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split
Only seventeen, he was finna graduate in like three weeks,
some stupid niggas got him for his chain,
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped,
Some dude snatched her and she was standing at the bus stop, wait,
man she just eleven!
What the fuck is up with this world,
got these grown niggas fucking with girls?
Plus the cops harassing us,
every week be blasting us, on accident, or so they claim
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain
They killed her only son,
Make her wanna blow her brains out,
Change the channel man I can't watch this shit...

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.

Take a ride through the city man and tell me what you witness.
Poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits,
violence, hatred, real devastation,
neighborhoods looking like there's still segregation,
welfare, single mothers, no jobs,
tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie,
fiegns in the street so high off of that crack shit,
this nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress...
White folks got the road to success mapped and that's all good,
but why don't black's got that same atlas?
I asked the same question a million ways
and it seems like I had prayed for a million days.
Still the ills remain - just bills and pain.
Shoot outs and project buildings, children slain,
skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why.
Its enough to make a nigga wanna cry,
but I can't though...

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.

We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same

Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that noila got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?

Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been?
You deserve rounds tonight, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight

She says kiss you like miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
ANd when you're fuckinq someone else
just fuck her like she aint me

Damn those words are scary
those words are scary virqin mary 
I just tell her to spare me
I was in 

Intro]
 I wanna hit line drives...
 Wanna lose weight and keep eating...
 For you...
 Hey, whats up doc?


 Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
 You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
 To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth
 I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
 The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
 Looked in the mirror, then realized I-I-I had something to prove
 You told me "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
 Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the road


 And I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), and I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
 And I run it, (Yeah! Blow!), and I run it, (Yeah! Blow!)
 That's ironic, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
 That's ironic, (Y-Yeah! Blow!), I run it, (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)
 Salt all in my wounds
 Hear my tears all in my tunes
 Let my life loose in this booth
 Just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused
 And I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), and I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
 And I run it, (Y-Yeah! Blow!), and I run it (Yeah! Blow!) That's ironic


 Liberation...leader...
 Popular pie plant pictured here...
 Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote!


 This shit make a nigga just wanna write
 Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
 Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
 Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
 I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
 Tell a story that I'll never glory 25
 Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
 And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
 Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
 Nobody gon' abide by your rule
 Nobody holding your gun, how come your tongue say killa then kill my mood
 Light speed living in the world you know
 Little old me, feeling like a live wire
 Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
 Til' I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
 I am from the bottom of the jungle
 Living in the bottom of the food chain
 When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
 A new name, want stripes, and you and zebra look alike
 Hope another homicide don't numb you and none do
 Things we will never learn soon
 In the era where we wanna earn soon
 That's a error, you can smell it in the air and everybody really doomed
 That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
 All y'all can suck my dick
 All them days at the county building
 Now I'm 'bout to make my mama rich
 Cartoons and (cereal!) I ain't felt this good since
 Scrooge McDuck, (here we go!) Elementary hood shit




 This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
 Even with a pot to piss in
 I'mma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
 Dismiss any business of yours
 Discounts never did amount to a check
 That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
 Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
 AKs for the whole hood
 House lick went down perfect
 Two shots to the head he deserved it
 I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
 Dark Wing Duck lost service
 Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
 Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
 I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
 This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
 Emerging on everbody corner (dash for it)
 Get a toe tag when you play tag with a task of a new (task force)
 Everybody wanna know my life
 How did I make it (past yours)
 Well let me tell you like this
 I've been running this shit since (I asked for it)
 Cartoons and cereal




 Salt all in my wounds
 Hear my tears all in my tunes
 Let my life loose in this booth just for you
 Mufucka hope y'all amused!
 I did wrong, karma came
 Crackers gave me ball and chain
 Friends, enemies all the same
 State, fed, both can hang
 Nobody can mute me, but I never said nobody can't shoot me
 Just another stat to the white folks
 Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
 Everyday feel like the one before
 Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
 If you do what you always done
 Then you get what you always got
 You dumb buffoons!
 I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
 For about the past 72 hours
 Hand on my heart, face to the hood
 I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
 Yeah this me, no mic
 No cameras, no lights, just pain
 Mama how much trauma can I sustain?
 Dirty money come with lots of stains
 Road to riches come with lots of lanes
 Just another player with lots of game
 Never had shit, got lots to gain...

Just another player with lots of game
 Never had shit, got lots to gain

Didn't you know, I was waitin on you
Waitin' on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know, I was waitin' on you
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When'd you decide to break the rules?
Cause I just heard some real bad news

People talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you, how long have you known dude?
You played it off and act like he's brand new
When'd you decide to break the rules?
Cause I just heard some real bad news

Real bad news 

Oh you just goin' keep another, no you wont
Oh you just goin' keep it like you never knew
Oh you just goin' keep another love for you
Oh you just goin' keep em like you never knew
While im waitin on a dream that'll never come true
Oh you just goin' keep em like you never knew
My face turned to stone when I heard the news

Whats on the news?
Channel cruise...



I was born with a dick in my brain
Yea fucked in the head
My step-father said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
"Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?"
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said, 
"I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid"
The bastard won't even eat nothing he scared
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead
Debby don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there stick a fucking cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's faking it
I bet you, I'll bet he prolly wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course unless you object
Ah, go fuck his brains out if any is left in his head



If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane



You get it? No I just tried to bite my face off
I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw bit the fucking blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop
Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like king kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he layed all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants he took every fucking thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yea, maniac that Shady dog
Man that motherfuckers gangsta, ain't he dog?
Shady dog, what be going through that fucking brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waiting for? Sing along.




Don't you know what felch means? (Yea)
Well then tell me, would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp belch and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying man? can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my step-father felt me
Fuck a little puppet kick the puppy while he's yelping
Shady what the fuck you saying? I don't know help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fucking melting!
Marshall I just love you boy I care about your well-being
No dad I said no, I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy I can do it by myself see
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it Pubic Hair on Chelsey
Well this is called Ass-Rape and we're shooting the Jail scene






I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I...
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real 


I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself




I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they mow that's green
I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you love me
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and their present is old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?




The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word "but", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real


"... I ain't trippin' off that Dominos anymore, just calling, sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did homie". "Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga". "Realness is responsibility, realness is taking care of your motherfucking family, realness is god, nigga"




"Alright that's all I wanted to tell you, just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom."

"Boy you better have my jawn on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't tripping. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by the food for less, and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take this music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago you know that's what we do."


Sing my song, it's all for you 


"If I don't hear from you, by tomorrow... I hope you come back, and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back, with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? talk to you later, bye."




Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial


Head to the sky, wings raised in
Shes about to fly and take her place in
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground
She’ll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But aint no going back, this is how it must be
He told her, she’ll be burned alive
She just told him trust me
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing she told her you’ll leave me if you loved me
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feeling’s as it engulfs her
Now she’s a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape
So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like, the end, question mark (question mark, question mark)


Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial


Don’t let me hold you back
I only hold you back
We on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby, so high, sometimes its so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to ballet
We pulled up to the valet, we’ll teach our daughter ballet
We’ll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she’ll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom
I would have been the best ‘Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know thats very gross but we getting very close
To our end, though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I’ma let Mos begin


Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you doDon’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

How could you do it
How could you do it


Okay now baby here we go, we go
No baby, me go
You got my heart
Baby this what it be for
I give it all as far as my feet go
What do you mean, me go
Why can’t it be, we go
What happens when people turn to tears
Dreams turn to memories
And weeks turn to years
Huh? standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish it came with a couple reciepts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl I swear you was a trip, lets make it a couples retreat (do it)
How cud my girl do this to me
Woke up sayin no, the World did this to me
Now I’m testing one two
Reportin live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle
But its not even half the feeling as hearing you shine
She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday
And I’m tired of lying in these puddles
I ask “Y” sometimes like a f-cking vowel
But hitting tree’s everyday like a f-cking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out.
So I could see you smile
I-I know you can see me now



Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial


Yeah boy,
better ring the alarm boy,
dem know its coming boy,


Oh my God, f-cking Bomboclat
I’m hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire,
tie a whore up with barbed wire, nothing but a broad boy,
I’m the real deal, and char-broiler on the bonfire
and Bon Voyage bitch, I’m like Chef Boyar-
-dee in this bitch; send a bomb to my moms lawyer
Im a problem for ya, boy you think your Tom Sawyer,
til I pull you out the f-cking story book and stomp on ya,
f-cking fictitional characters and fariytales,
prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris Wheels,
but it aint fiction its fact boy beware its real
them lyrics you wield equals zero to a hero’s shield
Mr fly by the seat of his pants parasail
or hit the trampoline bounce and grab a pair of stilts,
and I aint wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no nada,
like your fa-da f-cking ya mada


Drop the bomb on em,

Drop the bomb on em,

shady please, please dont drop the bomb on me,
Drop the bomb on em
I dont want no dog gone beef,
see aint no reason to set the dogs on me,


Boy, Im the real McCoy,

yeah boy you know we about to put it down for ya,
so kick your shoes off,

and siyanara see ya f-ckers tommorow,

and have a coke and a smile, dont make me open a jar,
whip ass on ya, thats the last straw your hoping to draw,
yeah you fresher than most boy, I’m just doper than all boy,
I’m that boy boy, them boys them no up to par
I just show up go up to the stage and blow up the spot,

Holten in this B-tch, Im the Proof boy your a fraud,
I destroy you boy, f-ck around and blow ya to Sod
oh my God boy, you didn’t go there, no you did not,
I got a whole story board for you, boy your da plot,
your gettin got whether you try to avoid it or not,
apology not accepted boy, Detroit is a rock,
we get to beefing, aint no telling at what point it will stop,
all I got to do is point to the spot,
when the bomb drops boy does it drop,
and when it does boy there’s a problem,




Boy dont jinx yourself,
boy I’m Michael Spinks with the belt,
Stringer bell boy, my name rings bells for itself,
I’m sick as hell boy,
you better run and tell someone else,
Bringin hell boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
and to that boy who done said it …,
who said he was better,
lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
i bet he never seen Freddie in a Black and red little sweater,
back better than ever,
the chedder shredder the grater the beef grinder
I’ll settle vendettas a little later,
giving haters incubators, think ya made a mistake,
by saying Shady was ghost, I ain’t even close to the gate
you bout a foot in the grave, stay put and behave
Im bout to turn this f-cking place to Beirut in a day
so hey wouldn’t you say Im the sh-t,
couldn’t agree with you more if you were to say my f-cking sh-t doesn’t stink,

Intro:
Where's my snare
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you eva been hated, or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin', and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigga me, but they'll neva figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probley sick of me now
Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ha!

I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Imma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a coupla months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side,
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work
Wit her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I grew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't't't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, MA!
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, MA!
But guess what, ya gettin' olda now and it's cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your FUNERAL
See whets hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yaself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get,
You selfish bitch
I hope you fuckin' burn in in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Let's get it, I can't wait to trick man
It's gonna be so sweet
Summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine

Still like, "Can you hit it with your OVO goose on?"
I'm like, "What are you on?"
Told me that she two on, ha, that's cute we a few on
I could show you what to do in this bitch
Take the addy with the water pop two and then sip
Me, you and your bitch
And we talkin' bout life, love too and this dick
First I had her in the six, then we had her in the six
You know I got another bar for ya
I'mma chill baby, we don't want the devil in this bitch, nah
Got a bad one we could call it Kelly Rowland
Oh she get the jelly rollin', Akinyele in the telly
Cause she open I could tell that she from Oakland
Pasadena, what up?

I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2

A nigga got a woosah, comin' at me never work no matter who try
I got 'em all a cheque without the woo-hah
Flip modes on ya quick got a few sides
Comin' from the 6 side
Where niggas goin' shower posse just to get by
Stay true never switch sides, yea, the game turn me into this guy
Yea, and now every time Drake out
Cameras always flashing tryna put me on the Takeout
Crib in Calabasas man I call that shit the safe house
Thirty minutes from L.A. the shit is way out
But these days that's where I'm stayin'
You can hear it in my voice I'm goin' way in
Yea, OB that my brother like a Wayans
Just know I only show up if you payin', nigga
Yea, I always been on, I always been too on
For like the past five years all these niggas wanna shine
I got the flashlight here man
Bout to hit the gas right here man
Old soul livin' in the past life here man
You, bring the cash right here man
Miracle, sit your ass right here man
Man, You know I hate to wait
That's why I get it first and you get it late
Yea, OVO sound that man that's everyday
It's Young Money Records get the record straight

I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2 on
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2

You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so bad girl, you're so awful
I fuck you right in my office
You go tell your friends you're honest
That's why all your friends are on
You know you made me a promise
We're not in this for commitment
Your man's gone and you don't miss him
Book you flights and confirmation
Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasing that paper
Even though you're exhausted you're still gonna make it girl
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so, you're so
You love to get 2 on

And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know that I put you on
And you know, that's something yo

That's what they doin', Cameron, they actin' like these singers, man.
I ain't goin' to the studio until I got a situation.
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer.
Who gonna be on the hook?
Man, what is you doin'?
Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!

Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though
Voice mail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, "nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, "the first mill gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work

Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)

Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man

Hear What?
Yo hear what, tek time
(Laughing)
Ahh, no shit!
Yo hear what?
Wa gwan ...
Yo him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van you know Drizzy

Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing

I do better with the rider in my system
Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we

Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker. Boys playin' Playstation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?

Yeah, sound sound sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this?
How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions
We ain't doing no interview

Yeah, yeah, oh, you gotta love it
Oh, you got, oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried
It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual, my career's like a "how to "manual
So I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we have words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to R.I.P. about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But man, oh, you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it


Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?


Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There is vomit on his sweater already
Moms spaggehti he's nervous
But on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over BLOW!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that
But he's broke, he's so sad that he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home
That's when it's back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody, better go capture this moment
And hope it don't collapse on him


You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better


Soul's escapin' through this hole's that is gaping
This world is mines for the taking
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring
But superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads got him
He knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold ya nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold prada
They moved on to the next shmo who flows
Who nose dove and sold nada
And so the so proper
His toll, it unfolds and I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on
Duh duh doe, duh doe, dah dah dah dah




No more games, I'ma change for due called rage
Tear this muthafuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped writin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Pfifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's gettin' even harder tryin' to feed and water
My seed plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a pre-madonna
Baby momma drama, screamin' on her
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotony 
Has gotten me to the point
I'm like a snail, I've got to formulate a plot
Or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only muthafuckin' option, failure's not
Momma love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot
Feet fail me not
Cause maybe the only opportunity that I got




Duh doo
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

CHORUS (1x):


END!!!


Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you


I'm just so fucking depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump,
but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up, 
in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided to just pick this pen
Up to try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, 
I need a new outlet
And I know some shits so hard to swallow, 
but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you got to walk a thousand miles


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humour
Everything's so tense and gloom, I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room
Just as soon as I walk in, It's like all eyes on me, 
so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that it then it opens the door for conversation, 
like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, 
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, 
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack, and half of them ain't even funny,
like "AAHHHHH!
Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn!"
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell, hell
We don't gotta trade our shoes, and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves, and flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could of either just sat on my ass, and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in, and get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never 
did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me, keep making that face til it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there holding my tounge, 
tryna talk like BLEGH!
Then I stuck my tounge on that frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson then, 
'cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story, not just based off my description
Cause where you see it form where you're sitting, 
is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a miles in eachothers shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you

Yeah, to my babies, stay strong, dad will be home soon
And to the rest of the world... God gave you them shoes, to fit you
So put them on and wear them... be yourself man, 
be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny... 
don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful

Here I go. Im a rapper turned singer. And you can tell that he smoke, but I don't need my vocal cords all I hit is C-Notes.
N.E.R.D flow, i spaz if im prevoked
I'm about to change the fuckin game, pass the re-mote.
Money is everythang, and its every other thing.
I'm part of the choir, its the motto that my brotha sang.
Cash is the right now, women are the post game.
Money-over-bitches dot com check the domain.
It's comin too soon, album on the way.
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon.
Oops I mean a red moon... I did it again to 'em.
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation.
I say, heavy metaphors, flow so over weight.
I can rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake.
Frost bite drizzy nigga, no body as cold as Drake.
Keep yo ass in-line, don't be tryin to roller skate.
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit.
I am twenty-one tell me who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real cause I'm getting hood lovin I ain't even talkin' street shit.
Young angel, young lyin and I'm done tryin.
I'm just doin, who's drinkin cause I'm buyin.
It's on meee, everything is on meee.
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin john B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet.
This is for all the stripper cause I know that they gonna bump it tellem back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it.
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear.
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year.
Text brackets and back and forth faxes
My money comin full circle, get up on my axis.
Maybe Imma kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest.
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles and a booth.
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience cause I want it to make sense.

White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness. DRAKE!

Wayne: Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes. And they might even say you should leave me alone.
Homie scared. Cause they just like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy.
Just like Shaggy I toat dat boom bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck bout ya'll
I ain't talkin moths but you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm falling but up I fall and if ya bitch in heat she can fuck my dog.
I went from penny pinchin to private planes.
Never sat on any benches, I got in games.
Starter carter ball harder, ten girls penthouse suit ya'll order.
Whatever ya'll please. wine crackers and cheese.
They take off their clothes and put on my t's.
This supplement im on got me feeling mighty
My gun and money don't split call that shit Siamese.
My watch make the frickin' time freeze.
Yah girl bless me she suck my dick when I sneeze.
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need.
And eighteen G's is why the chicken cross the street.
Whatchya know about it my niggas so about it.
If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it.
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer.
Got the shoty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me.
Im a bad boy obviously, pop one at your ivy league
I dont have a rivalry if so you will have a casualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually.
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering.
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery.
You got short salary, and I got long money, I got cash money, I got young money. bitch...

Dj Drama: See I told ya'll it'd be well worth the wait right

Hello
Yeah I just walked in
Yeah I'm good you still working?
Tonight, right now?
'Did I go out' yeah I went out
I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed
Shit... wine or water
You said something about a cold drink
I don't know, I'm delirious... night


Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy

But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
"F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing thats so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say

F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin' 'bout bitches
That we almost had
I don't think I'm concious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeh we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeh, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women thats living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on


Well I'm sorry" -- Drake
Are you drunk right now? -- Woman

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me


You're not going to come?
Guess i'm bout to just kick it here then...

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble

Why are you so paranoid?
Don't be so paranoid
Don't be so...

I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Drizzy,
Oh yeah Trey I fucking feel you,
They be staring at the money like it's unfamiliar,
I get it,
I live it,
To me there's nothings realer,
Just enough to solve your problems,
Too much would kill ya,
And when I leave,
I always come right back here,
The young spit it and everybody in rap fear,
A lot of ya'll still sounding like last year,
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier,
Nickels for my thoughts,
Dimes in my bed,
Quarters of the kush,
Ain't the limes in my head,
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD,
Yeah,
I want it all,
That's why I strive for it,
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it,
I know what's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Yeah,
I want things to go my way,
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,
And my mother tried to runaway from home,
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway,
And she cried to me so I cried too,
And my stomach was soaking wet,
She only 5'2,
And 48 hours all before I showed up,
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
Damn my reality just set in,
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
I do a lot of things,
Hoping I never have to fit in,
So trying to keep up with my programs is like a dead end,
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
And life change for us every single week,
So what's good,
But I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Wise words from a decent man,
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand,
This lost boy got fly without peter pan,
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,
In person I am everything and more,
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,
Just call me shop and bag drizzy,
And call me Mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy,
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad,
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
To big homie use a flash if you must,
And I swear I ain't asking for much
All I want is


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

It's like I know what I got to say,
I just don't know how to say it to you


Pardon the swag,
But bitches cartate,
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,
How come I can't,
Miss a woman like I can't miss cartdates,
Cheese,
But shes not in this portrait,
Life's fine but I don not portray,
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
I don't want the glow,
I want the glow ray,
And I'm a fuck the world,
But this is just foreplay,
Tired of hearing bullshit,
Bring her on to cowshit,
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than ? shit,
That's word to toronto,
So high up I got birds in the condo,
Ain't that a female dog,
Ask her who I am to her,
And she yell god,
Weezy baby go ? hard,
No further details boy.

Drake] 
I am on a 24 hour champagne diet 
Spillin while im sippin it 
I Encourage you to try it 
Im probably just saying that cause i dont have to buy it 
The club owner supply it 
Boy im on that fly shit 
I am what everybody in my past dont want me to be 
Guess what i made it

I just want you to see,come take a look 
Get a load of this n-gga 
Quit frontin on me 
Dont come around and try come gas me up 
I like runnin on E

On records im captain hook and my new car is roofio 
Damn 
Where my roof just go 
Im somebody that you should know 
Get to shakin somethin cus thats what Drumma produced it for 
Yes i make mistakes that i dont ever make excuses for 
Like leavin' girls that love me and Constantly seducing hoes 
Im losing my thoughts i say damn 
Where my roof just go? 
Top slipped off like Janet at the super bowl,

Since I got famous but b-tch, I got money to blow 
Im gettin it in, letting these bills fall 
All over your skin 
Got money to blow oh oh oh oh 

 
Richer than the richest 
We certified gettin it CM YM Cash Money business 
Higher than the ceiling fly like a bird, hit the gucci store 
And later get served 
We smoked out with no roof on it 
Them people passin so we smash on them 
Ballin out we keep the cash on deck 
Lamborghini and the Bentleys on the V-set 
Louie lens iced out with the black diamonds 
Car of the year Ferrari the new Spider 
No lie im higher than i ever been 
Born rich born uptown born to win 
Fully loaded automatic 6 Benz 
Candy paint foreign lights with my b-tch in 
Born hustlin too big n-gga to strive me up 
Cant stop me more money burn em up

Come to VIP and get a Champagne Shower

And Im with two women make you take a second look 
We poppin like Champagne Bottles But We Never Shook 
and We Goin Be Alright If We Put Drake On Every Hook

What's wrong nigga? 
I thought you was keeping it gangsta? 
I thought this what you wanted? 
They say if you scared go to church 
But remember 
He knows the bible too 

My baby when I get you get you get you get you 
Ima go head to ride with you 
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you 
Cause I (want you) 
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty 
Registration is out of service 
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving 
Cause I (want you) 
I want you more than you know 

I remember you took me to the mall last week baby 
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times 
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified 
That I (want you) 
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy 
I said you crazy 
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you) 

You said to me 
You said your name was Lucy 
I said where's Ricardo? 
I said oh no, not the show 
Than you spit a little rap to me like this 
When I turned 26 I was like oh shit 
You said this to me 
I remember what you said too you said 
My name is Lucy Kendrick 
You introduced me Kendrick 
Usually I don’t do this 
But I see you and me Kendrick 
Lucy Give you no worries 
Lucy got million stories 
About these rappers I came after when they was boring 
Lucy gone fill your pockets 
Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton 
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised 
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty 
Avoiding me? 
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly 
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute 
Lucy work harder 
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father 
I'm Lucy 
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly 
Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me 
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front 
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work 
I want you to know that Lucy got you 
All your life I watched you 
And now you all grown up then sign this contract if that’s possible 

I remembered you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room 
I didn't wanna self destruct 
The evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went runnin' for answers 
Until I came home

Uh,
I'm just so far gone, 
October's own, 
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong,
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown,
parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne

You know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A
Pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
You know, so... forgive me
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

Uh,
And life is so insane, 
Look what I've became, 
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why yo girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain

Me, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man.


Yeah, uh-huh


Uh, hardly home but always reppin,
You hardly on and always second,
When I'm awake you always restin,
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question,
I, I'm doin classic shit in all my sessions,
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin,
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions,
I just always did my own thing,
Now I run the game, you stupid muddasuckas

Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who,
Then they meet my pop and tell 'I'm ''Drake is just a younger you'',
And shawty wanna party so don't let yo girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ, of me givin her mouth-to-mouth,
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her,
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcom X an Martin Luther
I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady,
They just loose to love, those are tennis games lady,
Have you countin money goin dufflebag-crazy,
Sippin on Pink Floyd an puffin Wayne Brady,
Damn, who's line is it anyways,
I'm in the daze, you been amazed, y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage,
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze,
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right,
You look nice, and yo frame, makes me wanna bowl a strike

Best believe I understand

Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused,
The gangstas recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's,
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus,
Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this ibomb, I palm
The game like it's a spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great mike,
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this gon be a great night,
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white,
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,
This that major moment you've been waitin on for too long,
The best that ever did it an doin it on a new song,
UGK an Young Money too strong
Down in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

I'm on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city

(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
> Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will serve you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?


(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right


(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right
Aw Yeah

(Intro) 

Yeah, can't stop now... 
This maybe the last chance I get, to be famous 

(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 1) 

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist, they call me Slim Rothelsberger 
I get beserker than a fed up post office worker 
A murker with a mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered 
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter 
For a gangsta, you should of shit your pants when you saw 
The chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel 
I faced her around when his fangs come out, get your brains blown out 
That's what I call blowing your mind, when I come back like nut on your spine 
I'm a thumbtac that you slept on son 
Now here I come screaming "attack" like I just stepped on one! 
Lowering the totem til' he showed 'em, defiance, giant scrotum 
He don't owe them bitches shit, his bridges, he out wrote 'em 
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the south pole and 
Nobody fucks with him, rigamortis and post-mortem 
He's dying of boredom, take your best rhymes, record 'em 
Then try to thwart him, he'll take your punchlines and snort 'em 
Shit stained drawers, you gon' fuck with the guy that licks the blades of his chainsaws 
While he dips 'em in P.F. chang's sauce 
Game's off homie, hang it up like some crank calls 
You think I'm backing down, you must be out your dang skulls! 
I'm almost famous 


(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 2) 

I'm back for revenge, I lost the battle, that ain't happening again 
I'm at your throat like strep, I step strapped with a pen 
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are distorting my mem-ory 
Some are wrote on a napkin, do what I have to to win 
Pulling out all stops, any who touch a mic prior 
Is not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers 
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the whacko 'for 
I take a shit in his jackolantern then smash it on his porch 
Now get off my dick, dick's too short of a word for my dick 
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism you prick! 
Don't call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer 
I just blew up the challenger, matter of fact, I need a lawyer 
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast 
Beat his ass naked and pee'd in his corner like Verne Troyer 
Ya'll are Eminem backwards, you're menime's 
See he's in a-whole-nother weight class, his slugs your BB's 
Your bean bag bullets, you're full of it, you were dissing his CD's 
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheeties 
No peace treaty's, he's turned into a beast 
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the might DRE 
He's almost famous 

(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 3) 

Now there he goes, in Dre's studio, cupping his balls 
Screaming the wood off the panelling, cussing the paint off the walls 
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads 
He ain't giving 'em shit, he's scissor pinch a penny so hard 
He'll leave a bruise on the brawn so dark 
You can see the mark when it scars, til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out "AHHH!" 
His metaphors and similies ain't similar to them not at all 
If they don't like they can all get fucked, instead of sucking him off 
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by 
Like David Carridy, they can go fuck themselves and just die 
And eat shit while they at it, he's fucking had it 
He's mad at the whole world, so go to hell and build a snowman, girl 
The bullies become bullied, the pussies get pushed 
They better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me 
Cause I ain't looking back only forward, this whole spot blowing 
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it 
And while I'm being poetic, let me get a stork 
And raise the bar higher than my opinion of these women ? 
So bare witness to some biblical shit 
As the cold wind blowing, this world ain't gonna know what hit it, he did it, he made it, he's finally famous!

How much a dollar really cost? 
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts 
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, y'all 
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car 
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo 
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 
20 years ago, can't forget 
Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals 
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do 
20 on 6, he didn't hear me 
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu 
My American tongue was slurry 
Walked out the gas station 
A homeless man with a silly tan complexion 
Asked me for ten grand 
Stressin' about dry land 
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open 
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' 
He begged and pleaded 
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it 
Told him, "Beat it" 
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it 

Listen to me, I want a single bill from you 
Nothin' less, nothin' more 
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door 
Tell me how much a dollar cost 

It's more to feed your mind 
Water, sun and love, the one you love 
All you need, the air you breathe 

He's starin' at me in disbelief 
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key 
He's starin' at me, I started my car and tried to leave 
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see 
A reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him 
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor 
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser 
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious 
Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect 
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck 
I never understood someone beggin' for goods 
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could 
And this particular person just had it down pat 
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked 
Have you ever opened to Exodus 14? 
A humble man is all that we ever need 
Tell me how much a dollar cost 

Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment 
I never met a transient that demanded attention 
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' 
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different 
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless 
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? 
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies 
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time 
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin' 
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise 
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine 
Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin 
Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin' 
Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal 
Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up 
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus 
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy 
You looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet" 
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep" 
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free 
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power 
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve 
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost 
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God" 

I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me? 
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be 
Shades of grey will never change if I condone 
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs

Wake up Mr. West 



Uh, Yeah, Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah



And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way,
So this is in the name of love, like Robert says
Before you ask me to get a job today, can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS,
So I guess we just pray like the minister say,
Allah o Akbar and throw em some hot cars,
Things we see on the screen are not ours,
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far,
Where im from, the dope boys is the rock stars,
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars,
I guess they want us all behind bars.
I know it.


Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)


They say people in your life are seasons,
And anything that happen is for a reason,
And niggas guns a clappin and keep to squeezin',
And Gran (Grandma) keep prayin' and keep believin',
And Jesus and one day that ya see him,
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him,
The devil is alive I feel him breathin',
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin',
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us,
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down,
Now my lil cousin smokin those cigarettes now,
His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now,
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out...
Im Stickin around....


Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

(Cuz every worthless word we get more far away, and nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)




This is why I do this shit.

I think they call this, uhm, venting.

 1:

Look
Uhh.

This is me.
Still the same.
They want the hits.
I play the game.
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.
It all comes spilling out like i hit a vein.
Watt up lil Braw.
Watt up slum Ville.
I hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still.
The fans thinking that we all signed for one meal.
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.
That aint how it works.
That aint that how it goes.
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.
And I could use a writer to balance out my flows.
But I never share my thoughts,
This is all a nigga knows.
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised.
And I would be performing just as long as Im alive.
So every word I utter will be mine.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
Oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

 2:
I never cried when Pac died.
But I probably will when Hov does.
And if my tears hold value, then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us.
And Ill be standing in a puddle.
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.
And ima keep it honest.
Am so tired of being subtle.
Its just me, Forty, O, and nich standing in a huddle.
Staring at the members of my team.
Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme.
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.
I hope you tell your family this shit aint what it seems.
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.
And know I pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions.
At least I put it all in the open.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

 3:
Look.
Fuck all yall.
We ignore feelin's here.
Premature millionaires.
Welcome to my realest year.
Yeah.
I swear we making a killah here.
I should be on top of the world here just chillen here.
Uh.
But its funny having fans.
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance, and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit dont feel the same.
Yeah.
And plus things are just so real at home
People think Ive changed just because my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere so im never actually am alone, i just always feel alone.
I think im scared of what the future holds.
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.
Every girl I meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes.
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
All my old friends think i got a new crowd.
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.
I guess that mean they come few and far between.
Even though am living out what you would call adream.
Yeah.
And my uncle aint even messaging me.
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.
I hope this isnt one of those forever things.
Its funny how money can change everything.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant I'ma be a better you
Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville
For Phil, Listen even back when we was broke my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory
I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches bitches so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark skinned and Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out of touch with reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
Fuck em' then we kick em' to the door
Nigga you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave
I'ma need my shirt back
Nigga you know how it go

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably in Tennessee that says fool me once, shame on - shame on you.
If you fool me we can't get fooled again

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved


This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havn’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our seperate ways
So i’m single...
Thinking about what we had and missing you
But I aint santa, I got something for these bad b*tches too
I mean paprazzi on me trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthaf*ckin heart out, its drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me do I ever cross your mind
Because all this sh*t is new to me, i’m learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good
I know that n*ggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed
I promise to stay the same


I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest


(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me

(I'm doin my thing 3x)
I'm tryna be unforgettable...


This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say fo' life yall say fo'ever
Its hard but it's fair I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The names young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’m gon need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers

(?) so whats the deali young done everything in the A but f*ck chillin
So welcome to my life no two days the same
Like for yall to meet the love of my life her names the game


I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest


(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I'm doin my thing 3x)
I'm tryna be unforgettable...

It's over, yeah it's over yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I can't stay here no more and I can't sleep on the floor
Man, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving, yeah I'm leaving, yeah I'm leaving, I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm gone
I had to knock down the wall

No looking back when I'm gone
No looking back when I'm gone
No more (x16)

It's over, yeah it over, yeah I'm leaving, I'm gone
I've been doing this wrong, I've been here for too long
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit at home, I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid I'mma die before I get where I'm going
I know I'mma be alone
I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta hit a road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta know the road

Something is said, don't say that again

You got something to say, then say that thing

Now and forever, I'll bring it home
Now and forever, I'll bring it home

{just pull the plug!}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
(repeat all 2x)


Hand me an 8
Beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world {i'm here}
And shit on brandy and mase
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill {ahhh}
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot
And people goin' feel me cuz i'ma still be
The mad rapper whether i got money or not {yup}
As long as i'm on pills, and i got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin' makin' fun of your yacht
But i would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in the source
And a wardrobe i can afford
Otherwise i might get sent up back-strike in a ford
And you wonder what the fuck i need more vicadive
Everybody's pissin' me off; even a no limit tank looks like
A middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit i'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would i kill you and jump in a grave and bury myself

{just pull the plug!}
People say that i'm a bad influence

I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than rosco beating james tar senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {ouch ouch}
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that i used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, i kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that i failed 9th grade
You probably think that i'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, i just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
As i fall down a cement flight of steps (ahhhh)
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

{just let it go}
People say that i'm a bad influence

My basic disk will make you take a razor into your wrist
Make you satanistic
Make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains
Are rippin' out your skull so bad
And sew you back and be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "role model," i don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and hailey jade is shady's business
And shady's just an alias i made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when gil was payin me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You may be gettin' a bigger attitude than maybe kim's got
And the shit's almost got the same fate that grady's bitch got
I know that "just the two of us" would make you hate me this much
And just the two of us
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life
It's just words on a mic.
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a show business pig
But the funny shit is that i still go with the bitch

{just let it go}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin' to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it

That's the shit I'm talking about though
Like you changed up
You don't even fucking link nobody no more
You just dash me away like a cyattie
Yo, you cheesed me dog

Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it’s dark out 
To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss ya
Shit’ll come back around and get ya
Crazy like all my niggas
Crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the BAR exam
I drove in the snow for you
You probably don’t remember half the shit a nigga did for you

Ya, you ain’t really fuck with me way back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
How bout now?
Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?

Always been daddy’s little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain’t even say thank you
I had no money
Left from back when I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like “who’s this?”
I be like “me, girl.”
You be like “oh word, true shit?”
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel I have it like that
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I’m not even Christian I still went to church that year
Guess, I just had to pretend that year
I ain’t even see my friends that year
Places that I should’ve been

You ain’t really fuck with me way back then
But how bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
How bout now?
Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?

Why do I feel so alone? 
Like everybody passing through the studio ,
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role ,
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know,
And I don't have the heart to give these, 
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go, 
So they stick around kicking out feedback, 
And I entertain it as if I need that, 
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that,
My privacy about the only thing I need back but, 
It's hard to think of them polite flows, 
Mr. Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes, 
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes, 
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed, 
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows, 
Life was so full, 
Now this shit just being lipo'd, 
Always said I'd say it all on the right track, 
But in this game you only lose when you fight back, 
Black diamond bracelets, 
Showing you the basics, 
I can't live and hold the camera, 
Someone gotta tape this, 
I make hits unlike a bitch, 
That's married I ain't miss, 
24 hours from greatness, 
I'm that close, 
Don't ever forget the moment, 
You began to doubt, 
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out, 
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South, 
Watchin' whole show, 
Embarrassed to pull my camera out, 
And my mother embarrassed, 
To pull my Phantom out, 
So I park about 5 houses down, 
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown, 
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around, 
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus, 
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness, 
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus, 
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless, 
And promoters try to get me out to they club, 
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how, 
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, 
Standing with my next girl, 
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now, 
And shit could get weird unless they all down, 
And so I stay clear.

We from a small town, 
Everybody talks and everybody listen, 
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing, 
I've always been something that these labels can't buy, 
Especially if they tryin' to take a peice of my sou,l 
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez "Damn Drake fly" 
And he just be like "Silly mother fucker I know" 
That was your bad, 
How could you pass up on 'em? 
He just take them records, 
And he gas up on 'em, 
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em, 
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em, 
Oh they did Po, 
At least they tried to, 
And that's what happens, 
When you spitting what's inside you, 
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video, 
And they think they can market you, 
However they decide to nahh, 
But Forty told me to do me, 
And don't listen to anybody that knew me, 
'Cause to have known me would, 
Mean that there's a new me, 
And if you think I changed in the slightest, 
Could of fooled me, 
Boy in my city I'm da 2-3, 
Drug dealers live vicariously through me, 
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy, 
I'm just not the social type, 

And campus life is crazy understand, 
I could get money with my eyes closed, 
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo, 
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll, 
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know, 
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will, 
I got new shit, 

I'm gettin' better still, 
Little niggas put my name in they verses, 
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal, 
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill, 
And I think this got this "Making of a Legend" feel, 
Problem with these other niggas they, 
Ain't never real, 
Yea ... that's all I can say.

I’m more than just an option
Hey, Hey, Hey
refuse to be forgotten
Hey, Hey, Hey
I took a chance with my heart
Hey, Hey, Hey
And I feel it taking over


I better find your love and
I better find your heart

Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down


Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre
The concept of school seems so securrre
Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well




Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe




I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering "where the ballas' at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it



10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone till November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house takin' no calls
I done hit the stride, got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the wri-wri-wri-wri




Cloud nine, Kendrick Lamar, uh
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I started questioning God, what is my purpose?
He say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up man, I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again


What am I gonna do? Gotta have faith
Life is too much, understood? Where is your faith?
Oh, faaaaaaaith...
All you need is the size of a mustard seed


Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't bout shit, that nigga ain't bout shit
Spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature
and maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice
that said the Devil is a lie, make a better choice
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
with them crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her section 8
Then lost her faith again




Kendrick, I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
This about how faith works, yeah, murk it...
I had dreams of holding a nine-milla to raise Killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas ensue
The rat's lurking, vulture's circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
to make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach cloud nine, that's what my niggas bout
But it never rain in California 'less them pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Ray Charles voice




This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering is there really a God?
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
But whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
and wonder why I ain't never caught that feeling before
Maybe they know him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know is that he's real and he lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because he's testing your faith again

I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
than die and find out there really is, think about it 

Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights


She don't believe in shootin' stars, 
But she believe in shoes & cars
Wood floors in the new apartment, 
Couture from the store's department
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit, 
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Order the hors devors, views of the Water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy, 
Man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy, 
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these nigga's got me, 
I hate these nigga's more than the Nazis


As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights


I know it's been a while, 
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay, 
A-bay late-ly you been all on my brain, 
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no fema
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum, 
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa, 
Come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar


As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights

Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights


Lights, lights, lights, lights...

All aboard, okay, next stop, my basement… ha ha
I'll meet you down there

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Haters getting mad, they done had enough of shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touche me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's a no-no who even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I ought to just be honest but

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert, and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad, when I call them both faggots
It's all these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the weiner schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
Body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him
Homie, I'm the sheisse, pass Doctor Dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussys queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A even got a bidet
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator 



It's not me and you
It's not me it's you
Your reckless and you know it
They don't love you like I do
Say you're moving over, like guess that's just the motion

I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

I don't have a fuck to give
I been moving state to state
In my leather and my Tims
Like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chubb
That's my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
That's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling
'Cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone

But, I guess that's just the motion
And your phone doesn't ring when they got everything
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

Yeah,
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
'Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her
And she know it
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help

But, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh) 

(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.)
Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Drawin' a Blank like
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.

Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma do that for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()

Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
Imeet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

()

I grew up, a fuckin' screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need somethin' newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I won't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I, could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
Cause I'm tryna stay alive,
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet tryna dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? Aye who am I? (Yeah)

Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better dawg I can't lie
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to sooth your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

I always did shit the hard way, my niggas *** slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was broadway, Times Square
Kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chubacca
Whispers that he got it for the low low
Sell a, dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain, took her whip
The appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front door
His mama at home, she still let em' hit the blunt though
I told her hello and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash, and just asked
"What a nigga gotta do to get that? Put me on"
He just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga you know how you sound right now?
You won't my mans, I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me, when I look up to you
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't never want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show ol' girl what she missing
The illest nigga alive
Aye who am I?

Things change, rearrange and so do I (Aye who am I?)
It ain't always for the better dawg I can't lie (Aye who am I?)
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to sooth your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

I never felt better

(uhh, Young Money, Yea)

:
I know way too many people here right now

You too fine to be layin down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing Ive ever known
Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these n***as
All I needs a f**king red jacket with some zippers
Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers
I did it overnight, it couldnt happen any quicker
Yall know them? Well, f**k it, me either
But point the biggest skeptic out, Ill make him a believer
It wouldnt be the first time I done it, throwin hundreds

But its far from over

2
One thing bout music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that sh*t that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, its just game
Its just what comes with the fame, and Im ready for that, Im just sayin
But I really cant complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin Ima quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
Im really too young to be feelin this old
Its about time you admit it, who you kiddin, man?
Man, nobodys never done it like I did it (Ugh)

:

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated
against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,
give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the
evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but
they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...



I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm
cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I
never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me
inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a
multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father
must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,
no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I
couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it
work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm
man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest
shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot
Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...



Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you
think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'
your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'
through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of
Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew
up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made
that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your
gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna
know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but
you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't
admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare
you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in
hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess
what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...

*
Yeah
I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time, like
What it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then, but
I can probably tell you a lil somethin' now


Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin', I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels and they silencin' you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here
I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch chrome green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years
It's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap
It's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' dranks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like (vocalizes)
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring 07
Second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is whack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at the dinner table and say "my baby's famous and I knew it"

And it wasn't nothin' to it
I'm drawin' and drawin' till the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out


Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF


Closer to my dreams (Miss Andreena Mill)
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah (Yeah man)
I feel it in my sleep (Sing it to 'em baby)
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams


Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progress
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video has made everything right with ex (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Too many rappers and not enough-
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
They can't
Play pen drop out
The gray ten drop out
Summer 05 with the gray Benz drop out
Charcoal charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the awful dodger
Showed her I'mma
I told her I'mma
Bout to get my run-on so hold the commas
Times changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home



Closer to my dreams 
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah 
I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
Some shit about a message you left 
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" 
This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! 
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre 
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way) 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch 

So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
We can fly over the border "Let's go" 
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
 (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri 
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste 
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Plus he raps with his regular voice 
 (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys 
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ 
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! 
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
Do somethin'! At least one punchline 
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs 
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither 
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!) 
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Intro] 
Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging 

 
I'm withholding my anger 
Though I'd like to be the strangler 
Of this punkass little pussy's puny neck 
It's my right to insist 
That he acknowledge my existence 
But he just displays complete lack of respect 
That's what he says to himself 
As he uses magazines to trash me 
As he sits with both feet up at his desk 
Smokes a bag of his weed 
And starts imagining things 
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed 
And in his jealousy and envy 
It just whirls him in a frenzy 
As he turns on MTV and sees my face 
He don't exist in this world 
So he just twists and he twirls 
Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a race 
And it's destroying him slowly 
Cuz he does not even know me 
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes 
So he just tortures himself 
He has no fortune and wealth 
So he extorts someone else to get his dough 
And now he's acting like a bully 
So he tries to push and pull me 
But he knows that he can't pull me so he's mad 
He has no choice but to scream 
And raise his voice up at me 
Cuz it annoys him to see that I ain't scared 

 
You aint no motherfucking (bully) 
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking (bully) 
I won't allow it, aint no coward to no (bully) 
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully) 
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...) 

And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...) 

 
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies 
No more unfortunately 
There's so many motherfuckers that just are 
They just keep pounding at me 
Now that I'm down with 50 
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja  
But his ass is such a puppet 
Irv could stick his whole hand up it 
And just make him say what he wants him to say 
But shook-ass Irv's on a string 
And Irv's so nervous that he 
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay 
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough 
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf 
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down 
But our building's made out of bricks 
So you ain't taking out shit 
I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown 
So now you try to pull a race car 
And it backfires in your face hard 
Cuz you know we don't play that black and white shit 
Plus this guy that you fucked 
When you was ecstasied up 
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch 

 
You must be taking to much (E...) 

 
Now what bothers me the most 
About hip-hop is we so close 
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac 
We just lost Jam Master J 
Big L got blasted away 
Plus we lost Bugs, Slayed Son, and Freaky Ta 
It's like a never-ending cycle 
That just seems to come full circle 
Everyone's gotta be so fucking hard 
I'm not excluding myself 
Cuz I been stupid as well 
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart 
But as we grow as men 
We learn to let shit go, but then again 
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand 
We all got reps to uphold 
When someone steps on our toes 
It's no exception, it goes for every man 
But if Irv really gave a fuck 
About Ja like he claims he does 
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs 
But he just keeps feeding him pills 
So if that E doesn't kill him 
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed 
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight 
If the situation escalates 
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game 
And if I get killed for this rap 
I got a million in cash 
That says I will get you back in Halie's name 

 
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...) 

 
Get at me, dawg 
Holla

(with Big Sean, Pusha T & 2 Chainz)


Well
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is - when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe! Believe!


Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick she so thirsty
I'm in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me


OK, drop it to the floor
Make that ass shake
Woah make the ground move, that's an ass quake
Built a house up on that ass, that's an ass state
Roll my weed on it, that's an ass tray
Say Ye, say Ye, don't we do this err' day-day?
I work them long nights, long nights to get a pay day
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
And niggas still hatin', so much hate I need an AK
Now we out in Paris, yeah I'm Perrierin'
White girls politicin' that's that Sarah Palin
Gettin' high, Californicatin'
I give her that D, cause that's where I was born and raised in


Lamborghini Mercy (swerve)
Your chick she so thirsty (swerve)
I'm in that two seat Lambo (swerve)

Believe! Believe! (swerve)


Yeah, it's prime time, my top back, this pimp game hoe
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James hoe
I'm bill droppin', Ms. Pacman is pill poppin' ass hoe
I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money
All she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist
Them heads turnin', that's exorcist
My Audemar like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time and that's excellence
Two door preference
Roof gone George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake
So your Duncan Heinz is irrelevant
Lambo, Mercy-lago, she go wherever I go
Wherever we go we do it pronto


Lamborghini Mercy (swerve)
Your chick she so thirsty (swerve)
I'm in that two seat Lambo (swerve)
With your girl she tryna jerk me (swerve)

Believe! Believe! (swerve)

Well it is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
In the dance hall, and who no have teeth will run pon them gums
Caw when time it comes to my sound, which is the champion sound
The bugle has blown the many times, and it still have one more time left
Caw the amount of stripe weh deh pon our shoulder


Let the suicide doors up
I do suicides on the tour bus
I do suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam building like I'm the shit
Tell 'em "Give me fifty million or I'm a quit"
Most rappers taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up in your face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press, kid
Plus your my bitch, make your bitch look like Precious
Something' 'bout Mary she gone off that Molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I move in the lobby
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon see lawyers and niggas in Jordans


Now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane
Spit rounds like the gun range
Beat it up like Rampage
100 bands, cut your girl, now your girl need a band aid
Grade A, A1,
Chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds backpack around me
Cosigned by Louis Vuitton
Horse power, horse power
All this Polo on I got horse power
Pound of this cost 4 thousand
I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain pourin',
All my cars is foreign
All my broads is foreign,
Money tall like Jordan


Lamborghini Mercy (swerve)
Your chick she so thirsty (swerve)
I'm in that two seat Lambo (swerve)
With your girl she tryna jerk me (swerve)


It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)

(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
> Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will serve you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?


(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right


(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right
Aw Yeah

How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself "why do you hurt me?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know that you love me baby
Time to take you away from me...
Only over my dead body...


I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Mmm, mmm
F*ck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some 
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from

Yeah, you know me well nigga, yeah 
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the p-ssy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yea
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again 
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine 
And I be hearing sh*t you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yea
It's been that way from the beginning I just been playing, I aint even notice that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright


I know, I know that you love me baby
The time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body


You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And f-ck you to the niggas that thinks it's there time, yea
Don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever gave you a star boy
Or you wanna be a mother fuckin' funny guy
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart boy
Yea, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel now more than ever
My city love me like I'm Mac Dre in The Bay
Second Album I'm pack paving away
The backpackers are back on the band wagon like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby's mom last night
We took a picture Last night
I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And lost everything that I came with
Yea, feel like I've been here before
I still got 10 years to go, ha
And this is the only sound you should fear
And these kids where crowns over here & everything is alright...





Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I die today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucka for women licking their lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless
I saw but never noticed that a college point is right to
'Be all that you can be' posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote
But know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'd find it
And knew one day that you'd come back and rewind this, singing...



I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better tonight)
If you ain’t fucking with that
I don’t care (yeah, yeah, yeah)



Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff
I got a life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you: "You the only reason why I don't flip and go insane"
My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change
No, just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows them
Don't you ever go expose them
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself
I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's the tutor for me
Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except



Oh shit! 
Oh, I need that 
I need that sloppy 
That sloppy 
Like a Chevy in quicksand 
That sloppy 

This feelin' is unmatched 
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap 
Black (Pendleton) ball cap 
(West, west, west) 
We don't share the same synonym fall back 
(West, west, west) 
Been in it before internet had new acts 
Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack 
My innocence limited the experience lacked 
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked 
The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact 
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic 
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards 
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction 
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest 
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic 
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion 
Winnin' in every decision 
Kendrick is master and mastered it 
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction? 
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic 
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque 
But what's better than that? 
The fact it brought me back home 

We been waitin' for you 
Waitin' for you 
Waitin' for you 
Waitin' for you 

I know everything, I know myself 
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health 
I know fatality might haunt you 
I know everything, I know Compton 
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything 
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors 
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma 
I know everything, I know history 
I know the universe works mentally 
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me 
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money 
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's Ornery 
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies 
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition 
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision 
I know you know that lines from Compton School District 
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip about how it was distributed 
I know how people work, I know the price of life 
I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well 
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit 
The day I came home 


Nappy afro, gap in his smile 
Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd 
Runnin' home and the man and woman that crossed him 
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted 
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles 
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin' 
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language 
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted 
Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous 
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was takin' 
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it 
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor 
Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress 
And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil 
You spoiled by fantasies of who you are 
I feel bad for you 
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you 
If you resist, I'll back off go catch a flight or two 
But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace 
Than be an advocate go tell your homies especially 
To come back home 

This is a world premiere 
This is a world premiere 
This is a world premiere 

I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite 
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside? 
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind? 
Tell me something got me losing my mind, AH! 
You make me wanna jump 
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump 
(Let's talk about love)) 
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump 
(Let's talk about love)) 
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite 
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside? 
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind? 
Tell me something think I'm losing my mind, AH! 
I say where you at, from the front to the back 
I'm lookin' for you I react, only when you react 
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto 
When I was seventeen with the .38 special 
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real 
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel 
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway 
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway 
I can be your advocate 
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is

"Morning, Marshall."
"Morning, doc."
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
"Anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. 
Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"
"Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back"
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."
"Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and 
it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, 
we know you're a busy person."
"But I thought variety was the most important thing?"
"So what else are you thinking?"
"Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, 
and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."
"Steps?"
"Yeah, steps."
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?
"Well, twelve."
"Christ, I don't even know them all."
"Really?"
"Anything else?"
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, 
what do I do if I find myself in a situation where 
maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I 
get tempted to?"
"Take a drink."
"What?"
"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."
"Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink 
I already know what that's gonna lead me to."
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
"Man, what the fuck!?"
"Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? 
Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. 
We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall...? Marshall!?
"No, no, no, no, NO!"

Everything black, I don't want black 
I want everything black, I ain't need black 
Some white some black, I ain't mean black 
I want everything black 

Six in the mornin', fire in the street 
Burn, baby burn, that's all I wanna see 
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain 
It's such a shame they may call me crazy 
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin' 
But homie you made me 
Black don't crack my nigga 

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses 
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it 
I'm African-American, I'm African 
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village 
Pardon my residence 
Came from the bottom of mankind 
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide 
You hate me don't you? 
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture 
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey 
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me 
And this is more than confession 
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion 
I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it 
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin' 
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot 

I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black 
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black 
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black 
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks 
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back 
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block 
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black 
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that 

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society 
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me 
Curse me till I'm dead 
Church me with your fake prophesyzing that I'mma be just another slave in my head 
Institutionalize manipulation and lies 
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes 
You hate me don't you? 
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself 
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt 
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out 
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah 
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special 
CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you? 
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'? 
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree 
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred 
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification 
I'm African-American, I'm African 
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan 
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius 
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all 
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you? 
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you 
I can tell cause your ways deceitful 
Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle 
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him 
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war 
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy 
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door 
Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score 
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers 
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers" 
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day 
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays 
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements 
Or watch BET cause urban support is important 
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street? 
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me? 
Hypocrite!


I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25 sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?


One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt?
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

 


It’s like I'm in the dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won’t work
All it takes is one song on the radio you’re right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burned, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don’t suppose an explanation I’m owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I’d never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
'bout to go through’s tougher than anything I have suffered
Can’t think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"


I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy


And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pain of resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you?
The cause to my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone




I've been driving around your side of the town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders before hand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost half of a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back as they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it we are in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by Eminem
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
(Help, police!!)
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, hope you can swim good!
Now say you hate homos again!


I also represent anyone normally seen on the end of these jokes of a beat
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Backs to the wall, I’m stacking up all them odds, toilets cock
Yeah ‘cause I’m talking a lot of shit but I’m backing it all up
But in my head there’s a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I’m the ringing in your ears
I’m the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I’m your time that’s almost up that you haven’t acknowledged
Grab for some water but I’m that pill that’s too jagged to swallow
I’m the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult there
With the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mather’s the rapper’s persona’s have a facade and 
Matthew and Stan’s just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it’s gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them,
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don’t stop after they call you
The biggest laughing stock of rap who can’t call it quits
But it’s time to walk away
I’m ever guilt trip the baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time, I’m back
Before it fades into black and it’s all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers’ left off



Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh-t
When I hear talkin, I just dont know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams who Im racing with
You can see Im pacin it so that Im always chasin it
Wayne put me right here, thats who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own, but its lookin like July 4th
But I just wish theyd let you try it first
This time Im really goin off, fireworks



When I go off like July 4th
feels like a fire, Got to go higher
Its your revelation, my sweet celebration
light me like a rocket, cause can't nothing stop it
all I see is fireworks,
all i see is fireworks
every night its fireworks
every night its fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off like fireworks


I got this one girl, you know, in my life
so I say in this song, I say
I'm just such a gentleman
you should give it up for me
look at how I'm placing al my napkins and my cutlery
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you f-ck with me
who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me
yeh, I kept my wits about me luckilly
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
and you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
but I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
what an experience
you coulda been the one but it wasnt that serious
their was smoke in the air before now its me cleaing it
that felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
now I can see it in her eyes
Fireworks!

 


Everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that I still listen
and he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my Realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city I let her explore
ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close
yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first, that's why I'm really going off, Fireworks!



When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
If I die all I know is I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way
Money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'on't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'mma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D, I'm the holy one
Yeaaah, you know wassup
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong


I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdose on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it,(aye) please don't do it,(aye) cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,


Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind.
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize it happened over time
She says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you suppose to do
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions.
You know the game even got it like that.
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that.
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind (mind, mind, mind)
Tell em' I apologize it happened over time (time, time, time)
They know




I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy


Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal


Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, "Baby girl, fall in line, " ok
Made a million, off of denim
Fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "I'll nigga alert! I'll nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)




I touched down in '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with' us and we don't fuck with' y'all, it's no different over on this side
God damn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, "You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help"
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,
Ya'll keep talking 'bout who next,
But I'm about how big as it gets,
I swear ya'll just wastin' ya'll breath,
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,
I'm a make it last forever,
It's not your time 'cause I ain't done yet,
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,
I was made for all of this shit,
And I'm on the road box office sales,
I'm getting paid for all of this shit,
Ask you to please excuse my table manners,
I was making room for the table dancers,
'Cause if we judging off your advances,
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!




HOE, SHUT THE fuck UP
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rest do
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythang
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit
Good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth
Drink a fifth
Load the nine
Leave you split, in the half
Smoke a half, Need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me
And I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'
Lil' bitch


Oh Me. Oh Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that, that ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)
I'm blessed than a motherfucker,
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin' nervous, clutchin' they chests like a motherfucker,
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail,
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man,
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do. 


Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Yeah
Too late
I cant keep chasing em
Taking my life like that
Caught in a change
25 to life


I dont think she understands the sacrifices that I made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I wouldve stayed
But ive already wasted over half of my life I wouldve laid
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
Imma take control of this relationship
Command it, and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while ive stayed
Faithfull all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I aint heard you yet
Not even once say you apreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so dont hold your fucking breath
You know what youve done no need to go in depth
I told you, youd be sorry if I fucking left
Id laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny aint it, you neglected me
Did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but its,


Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life


I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that aint good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Till I snap
Dont think im loyal
All I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Dont I give you enough of my time
You dont think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why im married to you still man I dont know
But tonight im serving you with papers
Im divoricing you
Go marry someone else and make em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat em like you dont need them and they aint worthy of you
Feed em the same shit that you made me eat
Im moving on forget you oh,
Now im special, I aint felt special when I was with you
All I ever felt was dissed
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
Its ridiculus
And still I stick with this
Im sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Your addicive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away from
Im addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
Im drawn to this, so I guess imma mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time imma
Aint changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abiss
You screaming as I walk out that ill be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop
Im leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And its just


Too late for the other side
Caught in a change
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a change
25 to life
Too late
Caught in a change
25 to life


Worst...


Mothafucka never loved us, fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now, still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions, nigga we don't know shit
Flexing! Nigga, I'm just flexing
Nigga never loved us, do it look like we stressing?
Look at you, look at you and look at you, aww, I'm glad that they chose us
Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish, just to see if I'm finished


On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us... Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up?
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior


Hold up, hold my phone, mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us, now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us, so everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up! You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B




Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothing changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm coming back on my worst behavior


Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior

why would she make calls out the blue
now I'm awake sleepless, in you
hey hey hey hey don't say you will unless you will
hey hey hey hey don't say you will then play you will
i pray you will
misses so fly crash lands in my room
can't waste no time she might leave soon
hey hey hey hey don't say you will, you do
hey hey hey hey don't say you will, one day you will
i pray you will
when i grab your neck i touch your soul
take off your cool then lose control
hey hey hey hey don't say you will you will you will
hey hey hey hey don't say you will if you will i pray you will
i wish this song would really come true
i admit i still fantasize about you, about you
hey hey hey hey don't say you will, you will, you will
hey hey hey hey please say you will for real, i pray you will

Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit ain’t my fault, girl cause I'm lonely

Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody’s house that you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it, I’m not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae

This shit ain’t my fault

You know a lotta girls be...thinking my songs about them, but
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...


Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say you da fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate,
Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the matt and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

Cause,



Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffin theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 

Uhh, ah yea
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money
You know who you are, I got ya




Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night


Okay, back when I was sleepin’ in my mama’s crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin’ seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you
Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you
I'm saying...


Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
She got me
And we are we are we are
She got me


Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies' gon' disown a nigga
Like, give me 20 dolla, dolla
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', "Please play!"
For pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever
But...



(with Big Sean, Jay-Z)


What of the dollar you murdered for

Baby don't worry, I know that they got me

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now

And well that ain't my thing cause I

And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
And I thought about the things we did
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
I don't wanna wait forever

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Everything's so sad when you look back

On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick don't it
Reflection bring regrets don't it
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end

It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good

It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no

And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen, you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soul mate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you

She said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

These days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?


Yeah Grandmama
Told you I won't let you down
Told you I won't let this rap game change me, right?


When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
Oh no you'll neva let me down,
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)


Yo, yo first I snatched the street then I snatched the charts,
First had they ear now I hav they're heart,
Rappers came and went,
I've been hear from the start,
Seen them put it together
Watch them take it apart,
See the Rovers roll up wit ribbons
I've seen them re-poed, re-sold and re-driven
So when I reload, he holds #1 position
When u hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin
It's plain to see
Nigga's can't f*** wit me
Cuz ima be that nigga fo life
This is not an image
This is God given
This is hard liven
Mixed wit crystal sipping
It's the most consistent
Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy




I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit that seat where white folks ain't wanna us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
With that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music
And I just don't be feeling it
Racism still alive they just be concealing it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptised at least 3 or 4 times
But in the land where nigga's praise
Yukons and getting paid
It gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than do-rags to get your waves
Noting sadder than that day my girl father past away
So I promised to Mr Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And u know I gotta thank u for they way that she was brought up
And I know that u were smiling when u see that car I bought her
And u sent tears from heaven when u seen my car get balled up
But I can't complaint what the accident did to my Left Eye
Cuz look what a accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah and now romeo must die
I know a got angels watching me from the other side




We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this
That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental
Vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that is not what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte
I'm tryina give us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you, my many inspirations
When I say I can't, let you or self down
If I were of the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life in my grip
I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out




Who else you know been hot this long,
(Oh Ya, you know we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong,
(The ROC is in the building)
Built the ROC from a pebble, pedalled rock before I met you,
Pedalled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special,
Let you tell that man I'm falling,
Well somebody must've caught him,
Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em,
Number one albums, what I got like four of dem,
More of dem on the way,
The Eight Wonder on the way,
Clear the way, I'm here to stay,
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that, this and Jay,
Dissin' Jay 'ill get you mased,
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious,
Six Hail Maries, please Father forgive us,
Young, the Archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas,
The way y'all all follow Jigga,
Hov's a living legend and I tell you why,
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov still alive.



Stadium status...
Unh...
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Use to be Dame and Bigg's brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, now let the story begin
It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout; picture
us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out "Jigga!"
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, "He could change yo' life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the Chig'"
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib


Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Use to be Dame and Bigg's brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, now let the story begin
Begin... let the story begin... story begin
If you feel the way I feel
Why don't you wave your hands, hands...


Fresh off the plane, Im off to Baseline
Nothin' handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'Round the same time of that "Blueprint" one
And these beats in my pocket was that "Blueprint" forum
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'll bob his head and say "Damn! Oh, that's you?"
But by the "Black Album" I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like "Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Colleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum


My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Use to be Dame and Bigg's brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, now let the story begin
Begin... let the story begin, begin...
If you feel the way I feel
Why won't you wave your hands


Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito
Hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped "Jesus Walks" now I'm on the steephole
And we know, "New Jack City" got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that "Diamonds" remix I swore I was fast
Then my big brother came thru and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammy's I said "I inspired me"
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pick-and-roll
Cuz even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gon' mingle, yo
Heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like "Damn, no way"
Translate, espanol "No way, Jose"
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known THAT was gon' come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the city, Roc-A-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother


My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Use to be Dame and Bigg's brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

Toomp killed this shit...

Alls my life I has to fight, nigga 
Alls my life I... 
Hard times like God 
Bad trips like: "God!" 
Nazareth, I'm fucked up 
Homie you fucked up 
But if God got us we then gon' be alright 

 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
We gon' be alright 
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
Huh? We gon' be alright 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 

Uh, and when I wake up 
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut 
Behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down 
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down 
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life 
Painkillers only put me in the twilight 
What pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight 
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like 
Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy 
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow 
So my karma come and Heaven no preliminary hearing 
So my record and my motherfucking gang can stand in silence for the record 
Tell the world I know it's too late 
The hoes, the girls think I gone crazy 
Try and fight my vices all day 
Won't you please believe when I say 

When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga 
When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?" 
And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga 
I'm at the preacher's door 
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright 

What you want, a house or a car 
40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar 
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog 
Motherfucker you can live at the mall 
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know when it's illegal 
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero 
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal 
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you 
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you 
In the presence of your chico... ah! 
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool 
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you 
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog thats all 
Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all 
I rap, I'm black, on track and rest assured 
My rights, my wrongs are right till I'm right with God 

I keep my head up high 
I cross my heart and hope to die 
Lovin' me is complicated 
Too afraid, a lot of changes 
I'm alright and you're a favorite 
Dark nights in my prayers 

I remembered you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room 
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went runnin' for answers

yahh,
weezy, drew, drizzy go in

Lyrics © Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group


Fraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make believe, rapping 'bout my own life
Real names kill things, that's that shit I won't write
Cause my niggas still selling dope like they ain't on their third strikes
Camping out in that corridor, fuck you waiting on Jordans for?
I middle-man it for 23, just meet me somewhere around Baltimore
(Woo!) That's rare nigga, (Woo!) Ric Flair nigga
(Woo!) The power's in my hair nigga, (Woo!) I give this beat the chair nigga
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes: trifecta
Dope money, hope money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit – ungrateful niggas, I don't like


A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like


(This Chicago, nigga!)
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathing like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eating good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissing girls, cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hanging out that window it's about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? right?!




(Young Chop on the beat)
Fake Gucci, that's that shit I don't like
Smoking on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screaming Sosa, that's that nigga that I like
I don't want relations, I just want one night
Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes, cause I'm living life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealing light
Bitch I'm high off life, got me feeling right
Bitch I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like
And bitch we GBE, we just go on sight




We are not one and the same, nigga I'm fucking insane, fuck is you saying?
Yo ass been doing the same, shit, not doing what you saying
Dang, I told yo old bitch she was fucking a lame, turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holding that pain, I just hope you been praying
Bang bang, riding for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlifes
And I run this bitch like it's no lights, going hard the whole night
Cause I ain't going back to my old life, I promise




I done sold purple, I done sold white
Running outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowing up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas




I'm cold (Yeah), I'm cold (Yeah), I'm cold (Yeah) (Yeah)


I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might
See you in my nightmare, oh well how did you get there
Cause we were once a fairytale
But this is fair well


I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So goodnight, I made it out the door X 4
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road

And that you know
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know...

Okay I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gone do mine
You do you, cause I'm just gone be fine
Okay I got you out my mind
And The night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well now you know...
Tell everybody everybody that you know!
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know


I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might
See you in my nightmare, oh but how did you get there
Cause we were once a fairytale
But this is fair well

Baby girl I'm finished
I thought we were committed
I thought we were cemented
I really thought we meant it
But Now we just repenting
And Now we just resenting
The clouds is in my vision
Look how high that I be getting
And it's all because of you
Girl we through
You think your shit don't stink but you are Mrs. P-U
And I don't see you with me no more
Now tell everybody that you know
That you know!


That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know
That you know
Tell everyone that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know...

"Morning, Marshall."
"Morning, doc."
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
"Anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. 
Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"
"Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back"
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."
"Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and 
it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, 
we know you're a busy person."
"But I thought variety was the most important thing?"
"So what else are you thinking?"
"Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, 
and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."
"Steps?"
"Yeah, steps."
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?
"Well, twelve."
"Christ, I don't even know them all."
"Really?"
"Anything else?"
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, 
what do I do if I find myself in a situation where 
maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I 
get tempted to?"
"Take a drink."
"What?"
"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."
"Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink 
I already know what that's gonna lead me to."
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
"Man, what the fuck!?"
"Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? 
Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. 
We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall...? Marshall!?
"No, no, no, no, NO!"

But I can't complaint what the accident did to my Left Eye
Cuz look what a accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah and now romeo must die
I know a got angels watching me from the other side




We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this
That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him

Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you, my many inspirations
When I say I can't, let you or self down
If I were of the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life in my grip
I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house

Who else you know been hot this long,

Built the ROC from a pebble, pedalled rock before I met you,
Pedalled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special,

Its what you all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for damn it
They cant stand it, they want something new
So let's get re-acquainted
Became the hood favorite
I cant even explain it
I surprise myself too

Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on, with something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, here's another hit, Barry Bonds


(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
We outta here baby!
We outta here baby!
We outta here baby!


Dude!
Fresh off the plane, konitchiwa bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
As for what I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it and he lived it, spitted then he shitted
I don't need to write hits, I might bounce ideas,
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
Ive been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
They said he's going crazy and we seen this before
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no low-head
Cos my Dior got me more model head
I'm insulted
You should go head
And bow so hard till your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MC's you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MC's you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you can get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on, with something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, here's another hit, Barry Bonds


(Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Yeah, Yeah, We outta here baby!
Wha, Wha, We outta here baby!
And Mr. West is so outta here baby
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby


I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my eyes so wight like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I’m so fucking good like I’m sleeping with Megan
I’m all about my franklins, Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops I meant have them, I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies
Its such a hayvic, oops I meant havoc
And my drink's still pinker than the easter rabbit
And I'm still cold (cole) like Keisha's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it cos I'm so at it
I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice
and I don't lack shit
And you can get Barried
Suck my bat bitch


We outta here baby
We outta here baby
We outta here baby


Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on
Wit something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, man here's another hit, Barry Bonds

(yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated
against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,
give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the
evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but
they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...



I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm
cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I
never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me
inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a
multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father
must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,
no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I
couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it
work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm
man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest
shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot
Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...



Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you
think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'
your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'
through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of
Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew
up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made
that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your
gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna
know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but
you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't
admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare
you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in
hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess
what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...



Loving you is complicated 

I place blame when you steal 
Place shame when you steal 
Feel like you ain't shit 
Feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself 
Breakin' on marble floors 
Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours 
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special 
What can I blame him for 
Nigga I can name several 
Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin' 
A baby inside, just a teenager where's your antennas 
Whats your intentions where is the influence you speak of 
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her 
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure you ain't no leader 
I never liked you, forever despise you I don't need you 
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you 
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, thats for dedication 
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent 
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it 

Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof 
I can feel you vibin', recognize that your ashamed of me 
Yes I hate you too 

House keeping 
 
House keeping 
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto! 
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto¡ 
!Disculpe! 

Are you the reason why mama and them leavin' 
No you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it 
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it 
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it 
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out 
You was deserted, where was your antennas again? 
Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend? 
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend 
A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend 
Little brother, you promised you’d watch him before they shot him 
Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches 
You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven 
You even faced time instead of a hospital visit 
You should thought he would recover, well 
The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real 
Then he died, God himself will say "you fuckin' failed" 
You ain't try 

I know your secrets nigga 
Mood swings is frequent nigga 
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga 
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin' nigga 
Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and your the reason nigga 
And if this bottle could talk *gulp* I cry myself to sleep 
Bitch everything is your fault 
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend 
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed 
I know your secrets 
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin' 
And that time you *gulp* I'm bout to hurl 
I'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you 
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof 
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago 
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago 
And if those mirrors could talk it would say "you gotta go" 
And if I told your secrets 
The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness

{verse 1}
all niqht i've, been starin'
can you tell i want you ?
can't be too, wide open
but there's nothin, i won't do
ohhh... just want  you to know

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

{verse 2}
I wish i... wasn't famous
I wish i... was still in school
So that i can have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you crazy

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious


{fadey fade away.... lls .}

Hollywood Cole
Go
Ay Hollywood
Hollywood Cole
Go

You wanna know just where I'm at
Well let me tell you 'bout it
I put my city on the map
But let me tell you 'bout it
They tryna say I can't come back
Ay let me tell you 'bout it
Man fuck them nigga I come back
Ay let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it
Hands up, everybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like "man that's what everybody say"
Go and pop the trunk and everybody dead
Everybody scared of the nigga
Aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter
Never bitter
Niggas is faker than anime
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, woah
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake
Fuck good nigga we demand great
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait
The best kept secret
Even hoes try and keep it and I leak the damn tape
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Even secret service couldn't keep the man safe

I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

Get off my dick, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick nigga)
Get off my dick, bitch, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick, bitch, woah

Man fuck them niggas I come home and I don't tell nobody
They gettin' temporary dough and I don't tell nobody
Lord will you tell me if I changed, I won't tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine, and I won't tell nobody
This is the part that the thugs skip
Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through
(The break up)
Get to know somebedy and you learn a lot about 'em
When we long for you, start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breath without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em
It's called love
Niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
No more, no more
It's called love
Niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
(Nigga I don't sing about this shit no more)
But there a nigga in the club singing

I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

Get off my dick
But every nigga in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
Got all the bitches in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
And all they mamas let their kids sing it
Sing this song yeah
The baby mamas and the mistresses
Singing this song yeah
Song yeah, song song yeah

(The make up)
This shit is retarded
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless
That's a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Ariel Heights
Here's a scenario
Young Cole pockets is fat like little Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah fuck nigga I'm very sure
Fuck the rest I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home I'm the best in the South
When I'm in LA I'm the best in the West
You can test, you can test, I'mma stretch niggas out
Oooh I'mma stretch niggas out
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out
This shit for everbody on my testicle
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, ho 

I can make your bed rock

Im attracted to her
For her attractive ass
And now we murders
Because we kill time
I knock her lights out
And she still shine
I hate to see her go
But I love to watch her leave
But I keep her runnin back and forth
Like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day
Hot as a summers eve
Young money thieves
Steal your heart with ease


I like the way you walkin
If your walkin my way
Im that red bull
Now lets fly away
Lets buy a place
With all kinds of space
Ill let you be the judge
And Im the case

No Stevie wonder
She dont even wonder
Cuz she know she bad
And I got her n*gger
Grocery bag

She said Im caged in
I think her conscience is

But when that show ends

Lotion
Slow emotions
Roller coastin
Like back and forth
Hold it
She pose like its for posters
And I poke like Im suppose to
Take this photo if you for me
she said dont you ever show this
Im to loyal and to focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this she rejoiced this
She said your words gets me open
So I closed it where your clothes

She aint got a man
But she not alone
Miss. Independent

Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left.
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Nights over goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's dumb enough out there I blind fold her,
She still comes back to my crib, Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But i wont buy her a soda Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of fritos I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would i buy you a gay ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Man TIP told me on this hoe tip
Best tip I could give you to hip you
Never let these traits trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, shit
Dig you a hole
Take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, its you, but fuck it TIP, it's cool
I'm chillin like a Villain
Like the penguin in it's fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
before I tie a fucking knot I'd tie you in one bitch
you think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger although a nickle might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
there's a bombshell, scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was some motherfucking stud
Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way fo shizzle
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slot checks stob bizzle
So fuck scissors these checkers are bust like a blood blister


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP
And each one thinks "Say this shit"
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, put a sticky note to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gonna tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote 

Why are you so paranoid?

Hey there, don't even think about it

VERSE #1:

Tell me right now, you really wanna spend your whole life alone
A little time out might do ya good, might do us good before we be done for good
Because I could make it good, I could make it hood, I could make you come, I could make you gooo
I could make you hot, I could make you fly, make you touch the sky, Hey, maybe sooo
All of the time, he be up in my, checking through my cell phone, baby no

HOOK:

Baby, don't worry 'bout it

VERSE #2

All of the time, you wanna complain about the nights alone
So now, you here with me, stressin about a 2 liter, leave the attitude way back at home
Yeah, you see 'em look, baby, let 'em look, give you cold looks cuz we look cold
Yeah, you heard about all the word of mouth, don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world, loss in the world 'till you finally let that thing gooo
You wanna check-in to the heartbreak hotel but sorry we're closed


HOOK:

Baby, don't worry 'bout it
Baby, we'll go out to the floor

 Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

 Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see


Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right 
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
We elevated to new heights premeditated 
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate 
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance 
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop 
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know


So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

 Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see


So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack 


So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become

I got a bone to pick 
I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again 
(Aye aye nigga whats happenin' nigga, K Dot back in the hood nigga) 
I'm mad (He mad), but I ain't stressin' 
True friends, one question 

Bitch where you when I was walkin'? 
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta 
Black man taking no losses 
Bitch where you when I was walkin'? 
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him 

When you got the yams (What's the yams?) 
The yam is the power that be 
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street 
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can) 
I can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer 
What the fuck happened? 
(Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell 
But most of you share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell 
(A two man cell) 
Something's in the water (Something's in the water) 
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller 

When you got the yams (What's the yams?) 
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor 
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires 
24/7, 365 days times two 
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage 
Just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say... 

You goat mouth mammy fucker 
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves 
Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help 
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail 
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left 
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton" 
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest 
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too 
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' woo woo 
Ah yeah fuck the judge 
I made it past 25 and there I was 
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him 
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina 
Screamin' "Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok?" 
Limo tinted with the gold plates 
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast 
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfucking king 

(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk) 
We want the funk 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
(Do you want the funk?) 
We want the funk 
(Do you want the funk?) 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence

Better watch out sucker now I got ya where I want ya,
onslaught, coming and Im packing in my lunch up,
bunch a missile launcher and a bunch a contra,
van van full of ganja, now come on jump,
man stop marchin marshall on my gotcha,
doin’ the cha cha and the kucharcha with a quadri-plegic,
boogieing down to Frank Sinatra,
Lyndsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya,
who da knew the puda do ta me whats its done,
such cynicism when this isn’t in my system,
blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lip son,
so much on my hands, i got to give my kids a fist pump,
Chris-to-pher Reeves swimming in my swim trunks,
Mister, “help me” whats he said to me and then sunk,
women skinning them and cutting them up in chunks,
in comes the woman with cocoa butter skin ones,


Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-buffalo bill,
skin em up, hym em,
sew em up in those kilts, up in those kilts,
upa upa up in those kilts,
man you don’t want to go up in those hills,
up in those hills, uppa up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill,
buffa-buffalo bill,


Always, you can see em lurking in the hallways,
carcasues of caucasion females in his draw space,
how the hell did he fit em all in such a small space,
hide em in the wall but how long will the dry wall take,
well f-ck it then, I got nothing but time, I’ll wait,
until its dries for the moment i guess your all safe,
after I sand it and buff it I guess that I’ll paint,
my chainsaw’s outta gas my regular saw aint,
now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling,
you can even hear the evil spirits coming from within,
someones in, the back of my damn house rummaging,
its a girl, she looks pretty thin but I want to skin,
been on the hunt again, when will it ever end,
Evelyn why you trying to fight you will never win,
http://www.elyricsworld.com/buffalo_bill_lyrics_eminem.html
severing legs, arms, damn there goes another limb,
pull the lever then trap door, death is evident




Now what you know about Buffalo Bill,
nothing so chill,
f-cking hoe, you better f-cking hold still,
make sure none of that lotion in that bucket don’t spill,
cut em gut em and just keep stuffing those girls,
man I think she had enough of those pills,

sedate her, then I wait her come back later just to clutch on those steel blades
braids, baby when I cut ya dont squeal
I hate the loud noises I f-cking told you,
I keep hearing voices like
wouldn’t you like to go and get ya put ya knife
and push it right through it while ya put ya shishkebab skewer
into a barbecue or would ya do to her what you usually do to a girl who’s skins newer,


In a World of Sin doer this is turning into a torment tournament of sorts,
Christmas Ornament you are,


I”ll be sure to Gensu ya til there’s no more skin to ya,
boo ya who ya think you f-cking with,
duck because here he comes again,





I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly,
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it

Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home (home)

I’m going through changes
I’m going through changes


Lately I really, feel like I’m rolling for like Philly,
I feel like I’m losing control of myself,
I sincerely apologize if all that I sound like, is I’m complaining,
But life keeps on complicating, an’ I’m debating,
On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls,
Can see I’m grievin’, I try and hide it,
But I can’t, why do I act like I’m all high and mighty,
When inside, I’m dying, I am finally realizing I need help.
I can’t do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I’ve been having ups and downs,
Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying,
Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here.
I’m hatin’ my reflection, I walk around the house tryin’ to fight mirrors,
I can’t stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie,
I’m afraid if I close my eyes I might see her,
Shit…




I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin’ at noon,
Yeah dad’s in a bad mood, he’s always snappin’ at you.
Marshall what happened at you, you can’t stop with these pills,
And you’ve fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughin’ at you.
It become a problem you’re too pussy to tackle, get up,
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled.
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed,
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust,
Nah, it ain’t like Doody to do that,
He wouldn’t fuckin’ shoot at, no-body, he fights first,
But dwellin’ on it only makes the night worse,
Now I’m poppin Vic’s, perks and Methadone pills.
Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it,
Fuckin’ drug dealers hang around me like “yes man”,
And they gon’ do whatever I says when, I says it,
It’s in their best interest to protect their investment.
And I just lost my fuckin’ best friend, so fuck it, I guess then…



Don’t know what I’m gonna do,
but I just keep on going through changes


My friends can’t understand this new me,
That’s understandable man, but think how bananas you’d be,
You’d be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.
And everybody’s lookin’ at you, what you want me to do,
I’m startin’ to live like a recluse and the truth is,
Fame startin’ to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low.
I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin’ the same damn DVD,
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive.
And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin’ pills’ll make me feel alright.
And if I’m still awake in the middle of the night,
I just take a couple more, yeah you’re motherfuckin’ right,
I ain’t slowin’ down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, dole em out,
Daddy, don’t you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground.
Fuck, don’t I know the sound of that voice,
Yeah baby hold me down.




Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow I’m pullin’ through.
Swear when I come back I’ma be bulletproof.
I’ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few,
Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth.
Shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?
I think about the things I would never got to say to you,
I’d never get to make it right, so here’s what I came to do.
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too,
I still love your mother, that’ll never change,
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together.
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it,
But I swear on everything, I’d do anything for her on anyday.
There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains,
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn’t any pain.
But I can’t pretend there ain’t, I ain’t placin’ any blame,
I ain’t pointin’ fingers, heaven knows I never been a saint.
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history,
But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say,
I miss you self consciously, wish it didn’t end this way.
But I just had to get away, don’t know why,
I don’t know what else to say, I guess I’m…



Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach

I'm in Miami
I need to call up Miss Cassidy
My name is party, not participation
Sorry for the miscommunication
I need a drink and some tequila with you
You know what I'm trying to do
Hey, let's pop the E off at Liv
I've got some time here to blow
I've got the money to blow
I've got the money and blow
Don't have to guess how I know
Oh, it's a secret just for me, I'll keep it
You old niggas boring as bones
You put the PARTY tape on
You know what's going on
You know what's going on
She keep it wet like tsunami
She think she sunk the Titanic
I get her hot like Wasabi
She think it's wavy and gnarly
I think I'mma pop one for you
Drink one for you

Still in Miami
Most of these girls are too messy
I've got to do some reflecting
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction
I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like brrrrr
I'm on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type
I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight
PND ain't with the ray tay, you know Jay Wray
Got girls here going way way way way way way
Sauga city trip the pay day
Glo'd up off a gate way, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in their feelings these days
All in their feelings these days
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes
You should be afraid

I'm preaching, oooh
Preaching
Preaching, babe
Preaching, whooo
I'm a finally, finally
Yeah

You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Cause sometimes you feel tired, Feel weak
And when you feel weak
You feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
You gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that sh*t out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And be a quitter
No matter how bad you just wanna fall flat on your face

Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps as long as you feel 'em
To the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
Your coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a f*ck.


Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this sh*t till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out
I'ma rip this sh*t till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when your real
and you spit and people are feeling your sh*t.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much sh*t as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end.
Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this sh*t that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outcast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the sh*t does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people got a f*cking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you’ve got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.



Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
what is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And its absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.



Until the roof
The roof comes off
Until my legs
give out from underneath me

I will not fall,
I will stand tall,
Feels like no one could beat me.

I want you to understand something
that when I come up in this b-tch I want the fans jumping,
I want the fist pumping in the air,
I dont look like a millionnaire,
but I feel like a million bucks,
ladies wont ya fill your cups,
Shadys come to fill ya up,
if your a D or a C cup
you can even be a B
its just me and DRE
youll be in the ER well be strapped with so much TNT,
we may blow no not even CPR from the EMT
could help you to resuscitate
you busters must be flustered wait
you cant cut the mustard, whats your problem cant you bust a grape,
whats my name, shady came and just crushed the game,
its really not even fair to them,
cos they pale in comparisons
so much they might aswell wear a skin,
dont you just wish you could share his pen
cos this sh-ts getting embarrassing,
the fog is stinking the air is thin,
cos he wont even let them try to breathe,
da da di di da di dee, he makes it look so easy,
girl you just hit the lottery,


now this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on,
and hell breaks loose,
try to restrain us you cant contain us,
we still gonna make a statement no matter what we do,
everywhere we go it seems were looking for any excuse to just cut loose,
so this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose,


This is when sh-ts hits the fan,
like it just splattered on stan
this is the only moment that matters,
ya homie rolled in with Mathers,
like chaos erupts Ems in back Dres in the front
so do what we say at once this songs like a singer it hunts (?),


It makes em stay in a trance
no choice they have to dance,


Its like the play-off just making sure that we stay in the hunt
take a day off of what man you better lay off the blunts
you must be smoking something
you think I aint smoking nothing stay off my nuts,
now hit the floor baby time to wipe away all the rust,
shake all them cobwebs loose,
loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose,
yeah girl shake that caboose
I dont wanna see you try to make no excuse,
DRE is on the loose,
A Mongoose when its comes to the chronic use,
you know I cant stand to lose,
me and my goons are like animals,
we come through like a pack of wolves,
so we came here to retract the roof,
yeah man aint that the truth,
girl your mans like in the booth
definitely back up in this b-tch,
this is when all hell breaks loose,




Now I know your feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words,
A murderer in the flow, liquid courage im finna blow
as soon as we hit the door power surges head to toe
Im sure to push it as far as words are meant to go,
were in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows,
ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block widcha hoe,
with speakers knocking its 3 0 clock
me and Doc then proceed to drop (?)
and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door,


Yeah so let us in fore we huff and puff and we blow,
we aint bluffin for nothing
well knock the stuffing out ya
revenge is so sweet, move til ya injure ya feet
yeah move or lose it three,
move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably,
pass some of that (?) lil right there,
that would be pretty stupid to me,
born and raised in the CPT,
yeah Los Angeles whos in the streets,
them haters hating on me,
but I refuse to lose any sleep,
keep that deuce deuce in the seat,
Dre fall off thats news to me,




F-ck you, motherf-cker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga you ain't sh-t
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga you ain't sh-t
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be f-ckin' with you anyway, I need a baller ass, boss ass nigga
You'se a off brand ass nigga, everybody know it, your homies know it, everybody f-ckin' know
F-ck you nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the f-ck is really going on?

This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made end's meet, eatin' your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes without a Mercedes Benz and twenty four inch rims, five percent tint, and air conditioning vents
Hell f-ckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullsh-t, matador, matador, had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious, kept me up watchin'
Pornos and poverty, apology? No
Watch you volunteer it it while people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has it's day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter fact it need interest, matter fact it's nine inches
Matter fact see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin', my consensus
Been relentless, f-ck forgiveness, f-ck your feelings
F-ck your sources, all distortion, if you f-ck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
F-ck you think is bullsh-t, porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is deaf, a state of decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I the picked cotton that made you rich
Now my dick ain't free

I'mma get my Uncle Sam to f-ck you up
You ain't no king 

Complexion (two-step) 
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love) 
Complexion (two-step) 
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love) 

Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun 
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done 
Sneak (dissin’) 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga 
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you 
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down 
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention 

Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' Sun 
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run 
Sneak (dissin') 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga 
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you 
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down 
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention 
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival 
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival 
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken 
By different shades of faces 
Then wit told me, "You're womanless, woman love the creation" 
It all came from God then you was my confirmation 
I came to where you reside 
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes 
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with... 

You like it, I love it 
You like it, I love it 

Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2pac 
Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die 
Color of your skin, color of your eyes 
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby 
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey 
All my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave 
12 years of age, thinkin’ my shade too dark 
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid 
And forcin’ my dark side like a young George Lucas 
Light don’t mean you smart, bein’ dark don’t make you stupid 
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin’ “Woohah!” 
Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored 
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times 
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion 
It ain’t complex to put it in context 
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context 
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest 
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed 
Ain’t no stress, jigga boos wanna be 
I ain’t talkin’ Jay, I ain’t talkin’ Bey 
I’m talkin’ days we got school watchin’ movie screens 
And spike yourself esteem 
The new James Bond gon’ be black as me 
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea 
And it’s all beautiful to me 
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens 
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing 

Barefoot babies with no cares 
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car? 
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse 
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth

Yeah!
Stat quo
Doc Dre
I representin the A town
A town
Aye aye aye
I'm comin' from the A town
A town
Shady Aftermath

Yeah
Once again it's on
Em, stat now alive
And this motherfucker on
The ho's get naked
Soon as the song comes on
The niggas get reckless
It's off the chain
It's on
It's papa speakers
Knockin' crowds off the floor
They jockin' and watchin
When I walks through the door
It's him
Tell a friend
But you already know
Act stupid and lose it
Don't fuck with quo
I'm kind of different
Not the usual
Sippin' cognac between two beautiful
Two bitches at the club
Talk shit at your funeral
I came to get a buzz and crunk
Understand yo
It's crowded in back
He's jumpin
God damn it's slow
I'm cooler than cool

Courts suck me dry
I spent that bread
She need a daddy
Baby please, can’t let her grow up in that ghetto university

Cinderella Man (x4)

Who can catch lighting in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin out the nozzle on a fire hose, cry it and swallow

Cinderella Man (x4)

Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, takes his hands and cup em
Spin around to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff em

Cinderella Man (x4)


There's a storm comin that the weatherman couldn't predict
I've start to ball prick you better flea cuz I get ticked
it's a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch ya to the ground ya trick
It's a trap, fuck my last CD that shit's in my trash
I'll be God damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in a blink of an eye, so betcha I'll last
So keep winkin and blowin kisses cuz ur flirtin with death
I'm destroyin ur livelihood, I ain't just hurtin ur rep
I catch a flow and get goin,
No remorse, I'm showin they slowin, for no one, knowin there is nothing you can do about it
Zeroin in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I'll shut your lane down, if you can spot the parked in at 2
Arsenic flower, lighter fluid, saliva, what can you do
lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com
Go get ur crew, hype you up, stand behind you like "woooooooo"
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how bout you?
Now guess who....(Hey)
Here's a clue....(Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
Now, what's his name

Cinderella Man (x4)


If I had a time machine
I'd be...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Music is my time machine
So call me...

Cinderella Man (x4)


Fuck catchin lighting, he struck it
Screamed shut up at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward

Cinderella Man (x4)

Rewound the future to the present
Paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker he's the shit right now
he's...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Cinderella man sent to fell Shady dey
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell from hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with this Cinderella story,
nor did he come to do the same, or can't afford to be a lamo in this day and age
And at this stage in the game, mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old H-I to the new Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah
The coupe de gras, raise em high, in the sky
People are tryin to bring this place alive
Thanks for bein patient I will make no more mistakes,
shit my Potatoes baked homie the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin weed, yea faggot the stakes are high
Shit I ain't even supposed to be here by the grace of God
By the skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts I skated by
Now ya'll are on in ice with ankle weights I hate to lie
Now how fuckin irritated are you, how much in ur face am I
And there ain't shit you can do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and I'm a spittin image I mirror it
When I stand near it, ur pussy lyric I couldn't hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
Who? (Hey)
Here's a clue (Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater and lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
now...what's his name





I hate rich niggas goddammit
Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit
Who you had to kill, who you had to rob
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top dammit.
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator no ladder money
Escalating new caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money.
Crookest smile nigga momma never had the money damn
I ain't trippin' a nigga Jordan I ain't Pippen yeah
Up the steps I ain't slippin'
Tears blood sweat I ain't crippin, Pierce
A song you can sing along with when you down
So I let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas you think she out there getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga plus dawg I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crash and only it killed his lame ass
I'd be glad its that nigga
Did Kate dirty now it's back to broke
Refund check she used that to float.
Momma gets depressed falls in love with the next maniac
On crack use that to cope.
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crash the boat could of drowned
But I grabbed the rope

There go you (x3)
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew(x3)


You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul and uh
How much for your soul and uh


I hate rich niggas goddammit
Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now hear my shit and tried to switch now.
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't it more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power
Fuck it more to you, so I threw you
And it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for more money like Damon Wayons
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but it just ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watching little Jermaine do his thang before he made a name
It's like ? Basquiat
He gave it all he got now the nigga don't paint the same.
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Thinking old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame
My brain the same, yeah nigga at least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy motherfucker you just afraid of change.
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you.
And I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more.
Tad bit extreme I know.
Money can't save your soul.
But there go you

There go you
There go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And nigga who you (x3)
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew



How much for your soul and uh

Uh

I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinking Ima quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?

I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost


I’ve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn’t change
And I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? please don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours we both know
We know, they don’t get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste,ah
Pushing me away so I give her space,ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
I’ll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don’t know
Trying to run from that, say you’re done with that
On your face girl, it just don’t show
When you’re ready, just say you’re ready
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
And the party's over, just don’t forget me
We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won’t ever have to worry,
You won’t ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes


Cause if you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost


Yeah
It’s my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can’t deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don’t say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you’re following your heart
Cause your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know, you hate being alone
You ain’t the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin’ to save you
Instead they say,
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true


I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost 


Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn’t everything
I’m having a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that i'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time 
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well never mind,
I I I tried to told you, drizzy still ain’t nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cars saying fuck ya life
Okay now we outta here
Toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up
I got the voodoo for you bitches
I’m busy getting rich, I don’t want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double
Famous like a drug that I've taken too much
I never ever trip
Just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does


I'm about whatever man..
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night..
Whole crews in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team. Man I love my team..
I would die for these niggas..


Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her Imma get her
I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mix tape?
That was just a keepsake
Bought the president the Louie presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks I ain’t talking about the peach state
Man for Petes sake scratch that, sweep stakes
(hahahaha)
Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you like no
I’m a bad bitch I ain’t never been a mixed breed.
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed
M M M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
But I collect 100 thou at the venue
And pop bottles with my team young money til the death of me


I'm about whatever man..
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night..
Whole crews in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team. Man I love my team..
I would die for these niggas..

I mean, I mean but then again who looks at the price tag, you know


Oh yeah we in this bitch
Oww, oww, oww


I'm about whatever man..
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night..
Whole crews in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team. Man I love my team..
I would die for these niggas

I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous a**
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your a**
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that s*** you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go maybe I'll stay
Maybe I'll stay
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go

He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's about to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood

Ay from the dark I showed you my scars and I told you girl, I won't lie
If we at war, then this is a war that I can't afford (No I, I, I)
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I...I.. cry
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile
Lately
It's been hard for me to smile
It's been hard for me to smile
It's been hard for me to smile

If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home

He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's about to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic
I like to ask it, don't ask for
Your favorite rapper

(He dead) yessir
(Amen) chuuch
(He dead) I killed him
(Amen) bitch

And this is rigamortis
And it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus
The Matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit
You an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme
If you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin
And then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph
Into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures
My listeners reply and tell me
That you biting style
You got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while
Just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight
We always making them duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI, just might investigate
This fucking parasite

(He dead)
(Amen)

That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity
This is studio felony
There would not be so many
And cool enough for the 70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch
And bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant
Rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody
Couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q
It's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
So the system ain't why we ___
Ain't nothing else you can do

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I killed him
(He dead) hahaha
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask who your favorite rapper

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask who your favorite rapper

I rapped him and made him Casper
I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya
I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, once you sinister
Bible study faster
You hypocrite is reaction of blasphemy
I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done
And tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds
Don't talk to be bout no money
The sun is under my feet
And I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap
My statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek
And I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody done see
Some persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the streets
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick, in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
And y'all fucks, never could hassle me
And y'all luck, just ran out you'll see

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen

I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

You understand me?
Showtime, headlines
Big time, sunshine, tote nines
Bust mines, flatline, hard grind
High life, stay fly as jet time
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga
Stunt nigga
I might just bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe

Look inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt and never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don’t know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


I’m trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I’m looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I’ll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


You ain’t heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don’t you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3′s in the air I can see you are – in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I’ll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it’s alive
My new year’s resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say – Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe




We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!


Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here


Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth
Cuz the people that hurt can’t understand it
You speakin outlandish, I’m ashamed how to make it all work
Another planet, it’s a short term role for me
I rec it’s all for me, it’s just mo with me
And you’re here for you too here can re-persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin off, I ain’t takin off these pistons
I’m takin off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much it’d cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a shortterm goal, no sky is the limit
I’m past that, now pass that
A word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours


I see myself performing at
Soldout shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammys, winning 5 awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Can’t imagine how it feels
That’s why I’m smiling every day
Cause my dream ain’t far away


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


You’re looking at me and tell me I’m blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I’m at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, I’m reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I’m a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow I’mma take that I’ll never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I root
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin to you, I was walkin it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello


And I’m so happy I cry
Cause I can’t believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it’s so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you play so hard
And you’ve come so far
And you go, that is the time for you to leave your more
And I’m gonna do it
Watch me


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better 

K dot, pick up the phone, nigga. Every time I call, it's going to voice mail. 
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga. 
No socks and skinny jeans and shit. Call me on Shaniqua's phone 

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo 
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo 
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo 
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo 
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce 
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies 
On the dead homies 

I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga 
My lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga 
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga 
Fuck what they talkin' bout, your shit is where its at, my nigga 
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game 
You wore no chain in this game your hood, your name in this game 
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up 
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them benjamin's go cuddle up 
Skip, hop, trip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock 
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this" 
Thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix 
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras 
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers 
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you 
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you 

Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked 
The little homies called, they said, "The enemies done cliqued up" 
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio? 
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio 
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous 
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras 
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin' 
Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer 
The streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town 
From Compton to Congress, it’s set trippin’ all around 
Ain’t nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans 
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’? 
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs 
Make it they promise to fuck with you 
No condom they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?" 

Everybody want to talk about who this and who that 
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black 
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’ 
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum 
Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit 
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since 
Don’t ask about no camera back at award shows 
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my foes 
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it 
I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button 
Had the Coast on standby 
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box” 
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide 
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets 
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats 
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay 
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game" 

I remember you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence 
Sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screaming in a hotel room 
I didn't want to self-destruct 
The evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went running for answers 
Until I came home 
But that didn't stop survivors guilt 
Going back and forth 
Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned 
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
But while my loved ones was fighting 
A continuous war back in the city 
I was entering a new one

We got a young brother to stand for something! 
We got a young brother that believe in the all of us! 
Brother Kendrick Lamar! He's not a rapper, he's a writer, he's an author! 
And if you read between the lines, we'll learn how to love one another! But you can't do that 
Right on 
I said, you can't do that - without loving yourself first 

I done been through a whole lot 
Trial, tribulations, but I know God 
Satan wanna put me in a bow-tie 
Praying that the holy water don't go dry, yeah yeah 
As I look around me 
So many motherfuckers wanna down me 
But ain't no nigga never drown me 
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

Everybody looking at you crazy (Crazy) 
What you gone do? (What you gone do?) 
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving) 
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you) 
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart 
On my sleeve let the runway start 
You know the miserable do love company 
What do you want from me and my scars? 
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence 
How many times our potential was anonymous? 
How many times the city making me promises? 
So I promise this 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street 
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police 
And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends 
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme, yup 
These days of frustration keep y'all on ducking rotation 
I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum basis 
Dreams of realities peace 
Blow steam in the face of the beast 
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now 
The strong in me, I still smile 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

Walk my barefeet (Walk my barefeet) 
Down, down valley peak (Down, down valley peak) 
I keep my fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum) 
I keep my heart undone (My heart undone) 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

I went to war last night 
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic 
I'm a do it 'til I get it right 
I went to war last night 
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent 
Duckin' every other blessin', l can never see the message 
I can never take the lead, I can never bob and weave 
For my nigga that be letting 'em annihilate me 
And the sound is moving in a meteor speed 
From a 100 to a billion lay my body in the street 
Keep my money in the ceiling let my mama know I'm free 
Give my story to the children and the lesson they can read 
And the glory to the feeling of the only unseen 
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!" 

I lost my head, I must've misread what the good book said 
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside 
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called "Hi! My Name Is" dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I've went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain, the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to…

I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

I know what it's like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in that trailer park?
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than make another motherfucking "We Made You", uh
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania,
So when they empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was... gone

I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way o-o-out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear

Attention all units, attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
He could be coming at your girlfriend next


There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him unmercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone


Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!

I've been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? It can't be
They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
I promise to always give you me, the real me


Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go


Owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright life'd make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumbs could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do


Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Wait until the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

Im not lovin you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
Im in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, til its over love
Til we lose control, system overload
Screamin no no no, no no
I aint lovin you, the way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but cant escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else dont have to know


So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
You keep ya love locked down, you lose


Im not lovin you, the way I wanted to
I cant keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin to lose, so I gotta move
I cant keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when Im on my own
Somewhere far from home, In the danger zone
How many times did it take til I finally got through
you lose, you lose
I aint lovin you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to go
No more wastein time, we cant wait for life
which is wastin time, wheres the finish line


So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
You keep ya love locked down, you lose


Im not lovin you, the way i wanted to
I met no one new, I got no one new
No I said im through, but got love for you
But im not lovin you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin, keep the lovin goin
Keep it on a roll, only god knows
Am I into you, baby im confused
You choose, you choose
I aint lovin you, the way I wanted to
Way I got to go, I dont need you
I been on this road, too many times before
I aint lovin you, the way I wanted to


So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, you lose
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, ya love locked down
If you keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, you lose

Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there
There is no right or wrong
Only a song
I like to write alone
Be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasin' panties, gettin' dome
Had no clue what you was goin' through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl
Damn she so selfless, but she put up with my way
Because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together
(I love you mama)

Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it

Another day another rhyme ho
Another day another time zone
Today I woke up feelin' horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playin' on my trumbone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me
Nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot dog, catch up to me nigga
Uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was ridin' on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sittin' on the hood of this bitch
Like thanks for the view
Waitin' on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit gave you the blueprint don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showin' off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowin' soft
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing
Gettin' head like a coin toss
Too easy

Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it


Cause some things just don’t change
It’s better when they stay the same
Althought the whole world knows your name
So on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game
Ooooohhhhhhh
It shouldn’t be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice you remain
fuck em’ all, tell ‘em all eat shit, here we go again

So, god damn… is it that time again already
Haha, you don’t look too happy to see me
fuck man, don’t everybody welcome me back at once
All right, fuck ya’ll then


You can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, I’m nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, Dog fall back you mutts
fuck your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy
fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck sick mummy
And my nuts licked, gobble ‘em up trick, yummy
 b**ch you don’t fucking think that I know that you suck dick dummy?
You’ll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it’s funny!
Shawty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don’t listen to ‘em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker
Motherfucker might aswell let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, cause I’m just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on, cause you wen’t and pissed me off
Now I’m sitting and pissing on everbody
give a fuck if it’s right or wrong
So buck the buddah, light a bong
But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, cmon


Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh


fuck it I’m a loose cannon, Bruce Banner’s back in the booth
Ya’ll are sitting ducks, I’m the only goose standing
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my d*ck in a circle, but I’m not fucking around motherfucker
I’ll show you pussy footin, I’ll kick a bitch in the cunt
Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin’, you musta mistook me for some sissy
Soft punk looking for some nookie or boosom
Go ahead, fucking hater push me
I told you ain’t no fucking way to shush me
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G’s up
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!)
Man chill, nah I can’t god damnit
Rap is a land fill, drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can’t fill
shit the day that happens the world’ll stop spinning
And Michael J. Fox’ll come to a stand still
During an earthquake, urine in your face
Cause you’re fake, ahh what the fuck, that hurt wait!
Ahh what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening
Alright then I quit, god I give up
Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To hell I’ll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh


How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day
til I hang up the mic and it’s time for me to say
So long, til then i drop the fucking bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long
If you don’t like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh b**ches don’t like that, homie I’ll be nicer to women
When aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming
lyrics courtesy of killer hip hop dot com
Man I’m a cold soul, I roll solo so
So don’t compare me to them other bums over there
It’s like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
I’m bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I’ll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

(Outro)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I don’t know, I don’t know what caused, I don’t know what caused me to be this wayme to be this way
I don’t know, I don’t know by I probably be this way til my dying day
I don’t know why I’m so, I’m so cold beat bangs, I don’t need to say
I guess this is how you made me



Uh
I’m just so far gone
October’s own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screaming in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on
Where did we go wrong
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game
And its one I can’t post pone
Meaning if it rains
I’m the one its raining on
With my diamond chain’s on
Still nothing setting stone
Women borrow sweaters
That I spray with my cologne
And tell me don’t forget them
And I promise that I won’t
Feeling so distant from everyone I’ve known
To make everybody happy
I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown
Parties that we’ve thrown
I done more for this city
Than these rappers that have blown
Its only been 3 years
Look at how I’ve grown
I’m just in my zone
I call this shit the calm

Yeah

But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom
And I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay
And it wont even take that long
You can see it in my face
Even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school
Its proven and its known
I’m sittin’ in a chair
But in the future, it’s a throne
I know you like to worry
It’d be better if you don’t
Cuz….


You know…
Everything gone be all right
I promise
I apologize to you know
Put y’all in this position
40 Mama always say
Don’t ask permission, just ask forgiveness you know
So uhh
Forgive me
Yeah


Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a vantage you can gain
They love it when you smile
Unaware that it’s a strain
It’s a curse you gotta live with
When you’re born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say you’re the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Terrence in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It’s a weight that’s on my chest
Who ever spottin’ me is playin’
So I’m liftin’ all alone
Trynin’ not to get a sprain
Hopin’ Western Junior doin’ currency exchange

Cuz my dad called
It got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like
I had a rolls and I went and got a range
And he payin’ for his cigarettes
With some dollars and some change
Yeah
And I can only feel his pain
Cuz in Memphis, Tennessee
There is only so much to attain
So I’m fillin’ out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me
I just hope he doesn’t say that shit in vain
I’m why your girls heart is in a slain
Call me Heartbreak Drake
I’m the hardest one to tame
As a man, I’m just honest
As an artist, I’m a king
With my own set of problems
That be sittin’ on my brain
Yeah
And see this is the thang
What they viewin’ as braggin’
Is the way that I maintain
The shit I write
While starin’ out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I remain

Me


Yeah…
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
That’s why I’m putting on
They always wanna ask what type of act that you putting on
Like…. Damn 


Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn’t be driving, it just got so much harder
Can’t even see straight, I can’t even see straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I’m the truth that’s right I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain’t gotta die to get to heaven
You Girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How’d I know, how’d I know? That’s me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you asking me my where-abouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rappin’ bitches, rappin’ bitches bitches
And rappin’ rappin’ an’ bitches until all of us switches
I swear, it’s been two years since somebody ask me who I was
I’m the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
That’s whats important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing “walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I’m a uptown nigga, ah”
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways


People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)


Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon’ tell me that she don’t dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that’s all I’m really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin’ furs like its snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that’s the shit that she like
So why am I a classic, this is who I’m trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turnin’ papers in won’t get me paid
If I don’t nothing I’mma ball
I’m countin all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah I need that, making major changes to the life I’m living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways



People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)

Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do


All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting, I told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

 


Every morning when I wake up, uh, money on my mind
Good times and get caked up, uh, sunshine coming through my blinds
I’m living but, really though, it’s never enough
10 milli on, that's a must, living in California, everybody wanna visit for


Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Yo, it sound clever, come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA


These niggas’ll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck can’t y'all see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It’s a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I’m stressed


You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I’m forever living




My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him - some
3 W’s only for a three day run
Bitch, take them motherfucking panties off, you ain't no - nun, shit
I be living in the sky everytime I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control
California living 'til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know the priority order me Hennessey
And for my niggas OG Killa
Call it Jason Voorhees, boy he's on his job
Boy he sure be having the marks
On they mark, pretty bitches and tire marks
Let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost
For this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh
If I’m wrong then I wanna be right
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it’s not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off




Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, muthafuck your opinion
How many ways am I killing 'em, shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she’ll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I’m in a position of controlling, anything, I buy that ocean
I'm a boss I’ll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this


They want that shit, they often feind
I give it to ‘em, but in between, my time
I gotta tie shoestrings, life’s a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean toward 3 W’s in life
You know blow job need an application, eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like ‘em brown, just like my drink, the fuck you think
I don’t fuck wit’ no hand me downs, see if you fuck then its after me
You know how much I’mma make it work?
You know her dress, slip it in her purse
When you discussed your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first, Cali

 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question: 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two) 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question: 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
Want you look to your left and right, ask you friends 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me? 
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be? 
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime? 
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line? 
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off 
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car 
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K. Lamar 
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog 
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson 
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome 
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing 
But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question: 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And if you riding with me 

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her? 
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur? 
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt? 
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? 
Can you be immortalised without your life being expired? 
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time? 
Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent? 
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending? 
How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness? 
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended 
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing 
What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it's mentioned? 
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson 
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom 
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message 
That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And if you riding with me 

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues 
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you 
That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson 
I went to Robben's Island analysing, that's where his cell is 
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me 
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be? 
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs 
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow 
Murphy's Law, generation X, will I ever be your ex? 
Floss off a baby step, mobbed by the mouth a bit 
Pause, put me under stress 
Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect 
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall 
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead? 
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red? 
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shooter you assassin 
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it's Michael Jackson, oh 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga 

"I remember you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence 
Sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power, full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screaming in the hotel room 
I didn't wanna self destruct 
The evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went running for answers 
Until I came home 
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt 
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one 
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination 
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned 
The word was respect 
Just because you wore a different gang colour than mines 
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man 
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets 
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us 
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another nigga" 

Shit and that's all I wrote 
I was gonna call another nigga but, it ain't really a poem, I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to. Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you, I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground. What you mean ‘bout that, what the ground represent? 

The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil. That's how I see it, my word is bond. I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm saying, wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you know what I'm saying it's gonna be like… there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich 

Aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that's rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities? 

I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin', I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I'm saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying. I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us 

And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? 

By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true. You know what I'm saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying, I was noticing, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it's no problem, you know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know. I'm finna go straight through 

Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? 

I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been threatened with resistance it's been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back 

Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down 

In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. And you don't wanna fight no more. And if you don't believe me you can look around, you don't see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas 

That's crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today? 

Shit, I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be bloodshed for real. I don't think America can know that. I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka. You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen 

That's crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people don't understand how important it is. Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy I'mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes 

Because the spirits, we ain't really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us 

Damn 

I wanted to read one last thing to you. It's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says: 

"The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it 
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city 
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive 
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly 
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar 
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits 
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him 
He can no longer see past his own thoughts 
He's trapped 
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city 
The result? 
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant 
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle 
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same." 

What's your perspective on that? 
Pac, Pac, Pac

When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hoping that you’ll survive
Gather your wind, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

When I get signed, homie I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue eyed devil with a fat ass monkey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game, made a bad bitch yours
When I get signed homie I'mma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican, run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated but I got a million dollar check, like that

We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home

Yo what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keeping it, motherfucker

What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam on your dollar
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliche and say, fuck your haters
I can see the borrow in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies with a snow white collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me feel forever baby, count it all together baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
Too much and enough both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick
And when you get the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

Lookin' down is quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top you got it)
A lot of metaphors, leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'


It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya
See ya picture, now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya


Yeah, one time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch


I'm so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need


I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Air Force stunting flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that muthafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on


I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Takin' everything slow, so slow, so slow but I do it to her


Drapped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end


Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rollin' through the city
Bumpin' that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like everything just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone

(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.)
Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Drawin' a Blank like
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.

Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma do that for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()

Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
Imeet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

I’m livin’ in the 21st century
Doin’ something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the ’80s, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his own theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clock’s tickin’, I just count the hours
Stop trippin’, I’m trippin’ off the power
(21st century schizoid man)

The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We ain’t got nothin’ to lose, ma’fucka, we rollin’
Huh? Ma’fucka, we rollin’
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin’
Huh? I see you in the mornin’
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power
The clock’s tickin’, I just count the hours
Stop trippin’, I’m trippin’ off the power
‘Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours

And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they (21st century schizoid man)

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell ‘em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I’m an asshole? You niggas got jugs
You short-minded niggas’ thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice, brought the Dodies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He know, he so, fuckin’ gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn’t open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being prodded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin’ up with me
Takin’ my inner child, I’m fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece

Nigga, no one man should have all that power
The clock’s tickin’, I just count the hours
Stop trippin’, I’m trippin’ off the power
‘Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours

And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they (21st century schizoid man)

Holy, powers, Austin, Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin’ nation
They say I was the obamanation of Obama’s nation
Well, that’s a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day, goddammit, I’m killin’ this shit
I know damn well y’all feelin’ this shit
I don’t need yo’ pussy, bitch, I’m on my own dick
I ain’t gotta power trip, who you goin’ home with?
How ‘Ye doin’? I’m survivin’
I was drinkin’ earlier, now I’m drivin’
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin’?
I got the power, make yo’ life so excitin’ (So excitin’)

Now this’ll be a beautiful death
Jumpin’ out the window
Lettin’ everything go
Lettin’ everything go

Now this’ll be a beautiful death
Jumpin’ out the window
Lettin’ everything go
Lettin’ everything go

Now this’ll be a beautiful death
Jumpin’ out the window
Lettin’ everything go
Lettin’ everything go

Now this’ll be a beautiful death
Jumpin’ out the window
Lettin’ everything go
Lettin’ everything go

You got the power to let power come

Love yours
Love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive
Don't be sleepin' on your level cause its beauty in the struggle nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle nigga
(Let me explain)
It's beauty in the struggle , ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block man we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive


How did I end up right here with you
after all the things that I been through
its been one of those days
you tryin’ forget about
take a shot and let it out
let’s get right
now that I’m here baby...


show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
show me a good
show me a good
show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)


I live for the nights that I can’t remember,
with the people that I won’t forget
spending all the money I just work my ass off
for the things that I won’t regret
I’ve been waiting way too long long long long
tellin’ everybody that I know we about to be on on on on
I ain’t tryin’ look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with
that’s my team, never would I let a woman come between
what we doing right now
this our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream
I’m the Osirus of the shit right now
go to guy for the hits right now
whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now
if you can’t hold your liquor you better quit right now





How ’bout you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed
make the most out of tonight and worry bout it all tomorrow
understand girl, we fam girl
can’t get me right and I do Wayne
Cash money young money pop champagne
Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
people really hate when a backpack rapper get rich
and start livin’ that life dawg
feels like when you gettin’ to that paper hip hop hates ya
they would do it just like I do if they could
its in our nature
ahh, young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer
I came up in the underground though
so I’ma spend another ten thousand for Dilla
call me over rated or creative or too jaded
because any way you put it bitch I made it, YUP




Whoah!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
and like, back and forth because ah
this is.. what you thought it wasn't
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background*
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...


Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smocking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swinging, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman


So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screaming _Fuck the World_ like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck!!
Talking that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck!!


I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Search to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below friezing
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snorting, supporting abortion
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an Afghan




Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screaming like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinning
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfucking style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washing dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smocking weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in




Hey, fuck that!
Outsidaz..
Pace One..
Young Zee..


For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
Like them black kids
In Chiraq bitch


Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it


So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass


Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it


Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doing shit
Them niggas ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action


Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

Your walkin down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the mornin
And your in a
Nightmare
It's HORRIBLE
Right there's the coroner
Waitin for you
To turn the corner
So he can corner ya
Your a goner
He's ona ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
Cause you can't run anymore
Your done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody
Is watchin in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplading my next plot again
Swallowin the Klonopin
While I'm noddin
In and out on the autumn and
If the ramada inn
Holdin onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at mcdonalds
With
Blood all over me
Dead bodies
Behind the counter
SHIT
Guess I must of just blacked out again
NOT AGAIN

It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel
Until I find hannah montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin
Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin
Every candle on top of the fire place
Mantalin
Grab my flannel and my bandana then
Kiss the naked manakin man again
You can see him standin in my
Front window
If you look in
I'm just a hooligan
Who's use to usin hallicinogens
Causin illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Raise the scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules too
Me
What am I gone do
Had the prodical son
The diabolical one
Very methodical
I slaughtered them

It's 3 a.m in the mornin

She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin

I duck and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I
Had that much fun
Off a half pint of the jack
My last vic and a half
A flashlight
Up kim kardashians ass

I remember the first time
I dismembered a family member
December I think it was
I was having drinks with my cuz
And I wrapped him
In christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin tub
Cut him up into pieces
Then just when I went to drink his
Blood
I thought I outta drink this bath water
That outta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me
That might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams
Just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 am
And here I come
So you should probably run
A secret passage way around here
Man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs
It aint no stoppin me from choppin him up(up)

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure


How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9am in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?


Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas lookin' like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowin' that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's gettin' into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lackin' synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it’s meant to be
Paranoid, always rollin' with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

As i fall deeper into a manic state
Im a prime canidate for the gene to recieve the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of night quil then i salivate
Start off with the night quil like i think i'll just have a taste
Couple sips of that then i gradually graduate 
Too a harder perscription drug called valium like ya that's great
I go to take just one and i end up like having eight 
Now i need something in my stomach cuz i haven't ate
Maybe i'll grab a plate of nachos and i'll have a steak
And you'd think with all i have at stake
Look at my daughters face....
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad i think 
He's acting weird again he's really begining to scare me
Wont shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos 
And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat 

( Hook )
Sometimes i feel so alone,
I just dont know ,feels like i been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as i go home and close the door,
kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place i do,
But i cant and i wont say i tried but i know thats a lie cuz i dont
and why i just dont know..... 


( 2 )
Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer 
Thats the devil in my ear i been sober a fuckin year
And that fucker still talks to me he is all i can fuckin hear
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers
And maybe if i just drink half i'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man i got half a mind
Too have another half of glass of wine sound acinine
Ya i know
But i never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch im about to fall
I missed the couch and down i go looking like a bouncing ball
Shit must have knocked me out cuz i aint feel the ground at all
Wow what the fuck happend last night where am i
Man fuck am i hungover and god damn i got a head ache 
Shit half a vicodin why cant i ? 
" All systems ready for take off please stand by "

A couple weeks go by it aint even like im getting high
now i need it just not to feel sick ya im getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die 
Oh ya theres an excuse you lose proof so you use 
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin you to get through
It's twelve noon aint no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes
now here i am 3 months later full blown relapse
Just get high untill the kids get home from two homes relax
And since im convinced that im in-somniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so i take 3 naps 
Just to be able to function throughout the day lets see 
That's an ambian each nap how many valium 3
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken 4 years just too put out an album b 
See me and you we almost had the same outcome he
Cuz that christmas you know the nomonia thing
It was bolognya was it the methadone ya think 
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos 
your vcr tape cases with you ambian cr great places to hide aint it
So you can lie to hailie im going beddy bye whitney baby good night elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor 


( Hook )
Sometimes i feel so alone,
I just dont know ,feels like i been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as i go home and close the door,
kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place i do,
But i cant and i wont say i tried but i know thats a lie cuz i dont
and why i just dont know.....

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless

To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly

Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talkin' like it's just you and me

I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hill, man
I guess the money should have changed him
I guess I should have forgot where I came from

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

Excuse me? Was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homey, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell you who the side was

So I parallel double park that mother*** sideways
Old folks talking 'bout back in my day
But homey this is my day, class started two hours ago
Oh, am I late?

No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive

Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And then say something where you gonna end up apologin'
Let me know if it's a problem man
Aight man, holla then

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

Excuse me? Was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get passed
He don't even stop to get gas

If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of ***?

Must be the Pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, uh, dependin' how you dress her

So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam, Eve wear Nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort
'Cause when you try hard is when you die hard
Y'all homies lookin' like, why God?
When they reminisce over you, my God

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

Excuse me? Was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

Yo, I can't sing it....

I feel like singin'....

I wanna fuckin' sing...

Cuz I'm happy..
Yeah......I'm happy

Ha Ha, I got my baby back...

Yo, check it out 


Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think theres nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry 

Somtimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wasting my time? 

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 


Somtimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me 


My baby girl  keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, cuz they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side 

I act like shit don't phase me,
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive 

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 




Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singing this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mum didn't abort
Now you probly get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his momma,
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Cuz there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul,
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breaking should I just give up,
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself,
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin'hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted are nothing to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': 
3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to peoples backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', why'd I stick my penis up in?
Woulda ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted 

Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cuz my baby know's that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

So I ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me

What’s 50 grand to a muhfucka like me

We ain’t even s’pose to be here,
Ball so hard, since we here
It’s only right that we be fair
Psycho, I’m liable to go Michael
Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolleys that don’t tick tock
Audemars that’s losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks
Ball so hard, I’m shocked too, I’m supposed to be locked up too
you escaped what I’ve escaped
You’d be in Paris getting fucked up too
Ball so hard, let’s get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
So ball so hard, bitch behave, just might let you meet Ye,
Chi towns D. Rose, I’m movin’ the Nets to BK



Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me

She said Ye can we get married at the mall?
I said look you need to crawl ‘fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
Ball so hard

Ball so hard
What she order (what she order), fish filet
Ball so hard
Your whip so cold, this old thing
Ball so hard
Act like you’ll never be around muhfuckas like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch she don’t wanna dance
Excuse my French but I’m in France (I’m just sayin’)
Prince William’s ain’t do it right if you ask me
Cause I was him I would have married Kate & Ashley
What's Gucci my nigga?
What's Louie my killa?

Doctors say I’m the illest
Cause I’m suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris
And they going gorillas, huh!


I don't even know what that means.
(No one knows what it means, but it's provocative)
No, it's not
(It gets the people going!)


Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me


You are now watching the throne
Don’t let me get in my zone 
These other niggas is lyin’
Actin’ like the summer ain’t mine


I got that hot bitch in my home


You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don’t let me get in my zone 
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I’m bout to kill it
How you know, I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don’t let me into my zone 


I’m definitely in my zone

Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do


All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting, I told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

 

Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That being known let me know
Let me

Seems like street lights glowing
Happen to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fares
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the streetlights glowing
Happen to be
Just like moments passing
In front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fare
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

In the streets... In the streets
I'm just not there
In the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

Seems like street lights glowing
Happen to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fares
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the streetlights glowing
Happen to be
Just like moments passing
In front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fare
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the streetlights glowing
Happen to be
Just like moments passing
In front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fare
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

In the streets... In the streets
I'm just not there
In the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence 
Sometimes, I did the same 

If these walls could talk

Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway 
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out 
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey 
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play 
And shes plays only when you tell her no 


If these walls could talk 
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you 
If these walls could talk 
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it 

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good 
No boat I float better than he would 
No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth 
But your flood can be misunderstood 
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment 
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension 
Me? I’m just a tenant 
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute 
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation 
Interior pink, color coordinated 
I interrogated every nook and cranny 
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me 
These walls want to cry tears 
These walls happier when I’m here 
These walls never could hold up 
Everytime I come around demolition might crush 

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep 
Yelling at me continuously I can see 
Your defense mechanism is my decision 
Knock these walls down that’s my religion 
Walls feeling like they ready to close in 
I suffocate then catch my second wind 
I resonate in these walls 
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls 
I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in 
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest 
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them 
I’m not involved I’d rather diss them 
I’d rather call all you put your wall up 
Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush 

If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late 
Your destiny accepted your fate 
Burn accessories and stash them where they are 
Take the recipe, the bible and god 
Wall telling you that commissary is low 
Race wars happening no calling CO 
No calling your mother to save you 
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable 
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch 
Walls is telling me you a bitch 
You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them 
That sentence so important 
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me" 
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me 
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life 
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night 
So when you play this song rewind the first verse 
About me abusing my power so you can hurt 
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny 
About me and her in the after hours of the morning 
About her baby daddy currently serving life 
And how she think about you until we meet up at night 
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her 
And how she fucking on a famous rapper 
Walls could talk 

I remember you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence 
Sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screaming in a hotel room

Cole
Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back man
As I do so well

Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngen' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deep and
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said "You ever had sex before"
Damn

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no

I wrote back and said "Of course I had sex before"
Knowing I was frontin'
I said I'm like a pro baby
Knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know that
So she done wrote back and told me
"Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'"
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you laying on the bed
Teacher please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like "Yeah baby sound like a plan"
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned
Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin
Fuck

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no

You know that feelin' when you you finna bone for the first time
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying "God don't let me bust quick"
I'm watching pornos trying to see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in her crib now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
"I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you a pro, but baby be gentle cause"

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no

Strive of Victory

Standing at my podium

Die high blood pressure
You even let the feds get cha!

I'm amazin'
Born on the full moon
I was bred to get in
No spoon

That's why I'm so goose
Summer time, no juice
Big family, small house no rooms

They like oh god!

Look what he's been through
He deserves an applause

So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'


I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky


Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the 'No Smoking' sign with a blunt and a Marl'
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like three summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Mayback
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow


I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky


Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
+My life, my love+ that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never one to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule wore headset nine
Puttin' known ass on shelves
Waitin' paitently I ask myself
Qhere I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God "Man why'd you had to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure


I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky


I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say "Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I all had that snatched from me
And all the faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me
Cuz nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't bee a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off


I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky


I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me brother for a ride

I'm not sure anymore (more) (more) who is knocking at my door (door) (door)
all the friends that I know their but so sorry and sure

CHORUS
I don't wanna say goodbye to you so I'll just say goodnight to you
My people wonder why to you I'm just gonna say goodnight

VERSE 1
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could re-live it
Me and my grand parents on a field trip
and I'm a little kid trying to test the exhibits but 
In a faithful I get to get a hold of that
Men I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I would know the laugh
Men, I wouldn't let a moment pass
What would it mean when you dream that you're falling
What would it mean when you dream that you're balling
What would it mean when you never dream at all and u don't really know
but you can't recall them
It's all a fight to get a chance to say hi to 
people you never got the chance to say hi to
Maybe you could put them up out of your dream into real life if you try to
So close (so close) So far (so far) so far (so far) no cigar (no cigar)
you can't dwell on the past all we got is today so Ima live like there is no tomorrow

CHORUS

VERSE 2
If I promp my uncle live through you 
dream beautiful and unusual
wake up like every day new to you
stay true to you a whole musical
my uncle live through you
dream beautiful and unusual
wake up like every day new to you
stay true to you a whole musical

CHORUS

I'm not sure anymore (more) (more) who is knocking at my door (door) (door)
all the friends that I know their but are so sorry and sure

And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags!
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

She find pictures in my email
I sent this girl a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

And I always find
Yeah, I always find
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
Run away
... I get crazy
Just run away
... I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
... to get crazy
Why can't she just run away?
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

(Pusha T)

24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha?
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, they wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes wit' a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!

(Kanye)

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know it did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me
I'm guessin' you're at an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

And I always find
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

ssss Shady aftermath
G-Unit! Haha

()
Cause we came here to set this party off right
let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in thru the front we'll come thru the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without a least sayin' good bye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right scream one last time.

Get your ass up for the Doctor
One more time Get your ass up for the Doctor
come on now, here we go
cliffhanger it's another club banger
got you hangin on the edge of your seat
get on down

Time's up, game's over, you lose i win
bout to show these knuckle heads how to do this here
oooh yeah, new year
next phase begin
look who's got you goin crazy again
i'm a trend, i set one every time i'm in
i go out and just come back in full circle again
if you a fad that means it's something that we already had
but once your gone you don't come back
too bad you're off the map now
radar can't even find you
we stay on the grind
you slip we out grind you
you walk around mad you let your anger blind you
we walk around just playin the violin behind you
enough with all the pissin and moanin, whinin and bitchin
sit observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
why i'm sittin multi-platinum, later 3 diamond worldwide
we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin

(chorus)

When Dr. Dre says "Crunk!"  you will get it crunk (get it crunk, crunk, crunk)
and when 50 Cent says "Jump!" you will get on one foot and jump! (jump, jump, jump)
Applause is tremendous , we drop you all the senses
i don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
we keep the party rockin off the hinges
we ain't showin off we're just goin off popular consensus
but critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all washed up
knock it off! Who the fuck is Doc impressin?
Doc is this, Doc is that
you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cockadock cause Doc left you all guessin
so DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?)
we gonna have this muthafucka hoppin in a second (uh huh)
that's why we always save the best cut last
to make the scratch and mix for it like fresh cut glass
We swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
spoke to an generation of angry teenagers whom if it wasn't for rap
to bridge the gap may be raised to be racists
who may have never got to see our faces
grace the cover of Rollin Stone pages
broke down barriers of language and races
just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
to pass the mic don't need ta play back and forth like 
the hot potato game or somethin

()

50 Cent come on!
Now snap, hands up
you know how we do, we make the club jump everywhere we go
it's no secret, everybody know 
when Dre's involved there's plenty of money involved 
and plenty honeys involved 
it's sunny Sundays and palm trees, Cali
every day is just another party from The Valleys
all the way to the "make my" alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the Grand Finale
now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
blaze a pound of weed 6 days about the week
you can catch me in the studio bangin out the beatsta
provide ya with the heat that keep blazin out the speakers 
so never say never cause Shady Aftermath together along with G-Unit 
records presents the return of the "The Doc" (O'Shay)
no one can do it better we tear that club up and leave without a shred of evidence
and a...

()

yeah! haha Still Aftermath 2006!
And don't worry bout that Detox Album... it's comin! 
We gonna make Dre do it. Ha ha! 
50 Cent  G-Unit




Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!


I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty range I heard that
She wanna go and party, She wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
'less I write it down for real, P.S


You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song


I really hope you play this
Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice, Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.S...




Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve
Every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking poor maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P.S.....




"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, you gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your Grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?"
"Enough with all this talkin"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you out that mother fucker homie" 



Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black, white or a albino yeah
You can have corn rows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go *blah
From outta nowhere, you might find your career
Come to an *err and I'm just like (Oh Yeah)



See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)

See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)



Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let em talk shit, cause they talk shit
Knowing deep down, they really just wanna squash it
Cause no one wants to walk around, stepping in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum'
We just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm
Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiya'
Meanwhile your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
Right in the ass with KY, yes sir!
So full of joy, boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you
'Yea boi don't curr'



See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is G-Unit at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)



Ya homie got clapped on, man I don't care
The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is dogg, man life's not fair
Ya friend should've know not to front round here
Listen kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear
They'll strip yo ass of your jewels, right here
Man I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
Ya girl's a freak, man sometime we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You prolly heard about me, I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin, like I'm running for mayor
riding, winding, dining and shining, know what I'm saying
I ain't got time for fucking around, and horseplaying
I'm making hits, my homies taking hits, who's staying



See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)

It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
Last name ever 
First name greatest 
Like a sprained ankle boy ainâ€™t nothing to play with 
It started off local but thanks to all the haters 
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis 
And your city faded off to brown, Nino 
She insists she got more class, we know 
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo 
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo 
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album 
Whoâ€™d have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome 
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm 
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one 
Yeah nigga Iâ€™m about my business 
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list 
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness 
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness 
Bitches 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
I used to have hood dreams 
Big fame, big chains 
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came 
I went hard all fall like the ball teams 
Just so I can make it rain all spring 
Yâ€™all seen my story my glory 
I had raped the game young 
You can call it statutory 
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me 
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin 
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin 
You would think I ran the world like Michelleâ€™s husband 
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnâ€™t 
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnâ€™t 
Youâ€™re such a fucking loser 
He didnâ€™t even go to class Bueller 
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back 
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack 
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac 
All the way in Hollywood and I canâ€™t even act 
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap 
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
Ok, hello it's da Martian 
Space jam Jordanâ€™s 
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden 
Fresher than the harvest 
Step up to the target 
If I had one guess than I guess Iâ€™m just New Orleans 
And I will never stop like Iâ€™m running from the cops 
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top 
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops 
But what should I scream for this is my theme park 
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark 
Pistol on my side you donâ€™t wanna hear that thing talk 
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention 
Lil Wayne thatâ€™s what they got to say or mention 
Iâ€™m like Nevada in the middle of the summer 
Iâ€™m resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover 
Shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas 
No brake pads, no such thing as last 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
There they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow 
Nuts they go, macadamia they go so ballistic, whoa 
We can make them look like Bosoâ€™s 
Heâ€™s wondering if he should spit this slow 
Fuck no! Go for broke 
His cup just runneth over, oh no 
He ainâ€™t had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed 
Theyâ€™ve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose 
Back into the game and they know 
Rap will never be the same as before 
Bashing in the brains of these hoes 
And establishing a name as he goes 
The passion and the flame is ignited 
You canâ€™t put it out once we light it 
This shit is exactly what the fuck that Iâ€™m talking about when we riot 
You dealinâ€™ with a few true villains 
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillinâ€™ 
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths 
Now rewind it! 
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me, so howâ€™s it taste? 
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place 
Iâ€™m Hannibal Lecter so just in case youâ€™re thinking of saving face 
You ainâ€™t gonna have no face to save by the time Iâ€™m through with this place 
So Drakeâ€¦ 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man

byy: chelsey baybayy!!


Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to pick it
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch


Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long


We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) shake your body


Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khaki's pressed, Nike shoes just crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made Em just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in dang, bang bang
Yes sir Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang dang
P-p-p-pow chicka pow chicka wow wow
Got your gal blowin' up a val-v-v-v-val-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now hoe




We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) get your vials




And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard, drugs are though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you a loan, car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers, shit head with a potty mouth
Get the bar soap lathered, Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl you’re fixin' to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd man
You birdbrain baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you’re a swallow
Word, Rick word man you heard, but don’t be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam





And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags!
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

She find pictures in my email
I sent this girl a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

And I always find
Yeah, I always find
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
Run away
... I get crazy
Just run away
... I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
... to get crazy
Why can't she just run away?
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

(Pusha T)

24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha?
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, they wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes wit' a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!

(Kanye)

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know it did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me
I'm guessin' you're at an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

And I always find
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish
Hit this house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know its vacant, ya bish
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherene then went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Parked the car and then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel


Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 at the school
You know big ballin with my homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality we poor, ya bish
Another casualty at war, ya bish
Two bullets in my uncle tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish
That Louie's Burger never be the same
A louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin'
Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hoping all of em offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gone crash it when nobodies home


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel


Be the last one out to get this dough? , No Way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes?, No Way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No Way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No Way


Imagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, everyday I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em, get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel



Hol it, Hol it, Hol it, Hol it, Hol it
Y'all sleepin' in the streets
Shaky warrior
Yeah, this that Oliver 40, Niko shit man, 15 Fort York shit ya know
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?

Yeah, yeah
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari then I swerve
I want that Bugatti just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me I guess I know myself
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that
My city too turnt up I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbraud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
That's when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man I'm talkin' way before hashtags

I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go

Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up in here got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie
Yeah, and you know how that shit go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go

She know it, it a no big
Always haffi look out an ya know if yuh head buk out
Dun know, a de unruly boss, dis man
No bomboclat, otha
And if a boy nuh like
OVO crew my nigga can just suck ya motha
With no apology, If you nuh like we, we nuh like you neither youth
Your girl a say we cute, if you diss you will get execute
That's the truth, OVO unruly

(machine gun shots)

With my woes


Fuck dat
8 doobies to the face
Fuck dat
12 bottles in the case
Nigga, fuck dat
2 pills and a half, wait
Nigga, fuck dat
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist


Man, I swear
My nigga trippin off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him vicodin
Hope to take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of section 8
And you feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are
A loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins
Make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin off
My generation sippin cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition
That the world is bout to end
Who gives a fuck? we never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
A melody and some hoes
Playstation and some drank
Technology bumping Soul
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd, that's product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black
She black too
Purple label on her back
But that dap
Is like when she take it straight to the head
Then she look at me
She got AD-HD




Like woah oh oh woah (x4)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(They always told me ad-hd did it)


And then she started
And then she started
Feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
Beg you pardon
Oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23
Ok then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said where my drink at?
I'mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors
Have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds
Closed the screen, jumbotron
Made it to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it
Then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That ADHD crazy






You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six
Just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, dro, hoes
Whatever you like
You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light


You still love me?
Take this. 
You ready? 1.. 2.. 3! 


The more you, put me through,
The more it makes me wanna come back to you,
You say you hate me, I just love you more,
You don't want me, I just want you more,
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
I know it's sad but it's making me happy,
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
Cause you love me, and I love you more.


It's sick, but who could ever predict,
We'd be doin' the same shit,
We say we do it for our baby but we don't,
We do it for us, it's lust,
Cause neither one of us trusts each other,
So we fuck 'til we bust,
Then we cuss each other, out,
We know what it's about,
Shout 'til I throw you out the house,
You throw me out the house,
I throw you on the couch,
Punch you in the mouth,
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,
And apologize after,
Laughter, pain, it's insane,
We're back in the same chapter again,
And it's sad but it's true,
When I'm layin' here with you,
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.




Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,
It makes me wanna just take you,
And just throw you on the bed,
And fuck you like I don't even know you,
You fuck other people, and I fuck other people,
You a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,
We're both evil in our ways,
But neither one of us would ever admit it,
Cause one of us would have one up on the other,
So forget it,
We can make accusations, people spread rumors,
But they ain't got proof,
'Til they do it's just the two of us,
It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me,
But you gotta believe me to a degree,
Cause true indeed if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,
Yeah I would cause the sex is too damn good,
If I ran who would I run to,
That would be this soft and warm,
So it's off and on, usually more off than on,
But at least we know that we share this common bond,
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on,
I hope, the only reason that I cope,
Is cause of that fact,
And plus I can bust in that,
And that's why...




I could never understand it,
That's why I don't try,
From junior high until we both die,
It's silly ho why must we try,
Is it really so rough,
That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,
Try to pull each other's legs,
Until the other begs,
We're liein' to ourselves,
That's the beauty of it yeah,
Cause we truly love each other,
That's why we always fight,
And all we do is shove each other,
Every other fuckin' night,
And it's clear it ain't gonna change,
It's pent up rage,
We both have,
We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,
We've both been,
Someone else's someone else,
Problem is neither one wants help,
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed,
Our family's mixed up,
There's a baby sister in the mix,
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,
On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,
All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,
But I won't be made a fool of,
If this is true love,
You wouldn't do what,
You did last time,
You wouldn't screw up,
This time,
Cause this time girl,
I'm telling you what,
You do it again I'm fucking you up,
No matter what...


What you say, what you do,
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,
No matter where you run, I'll be right there,
Right behind you, in your nightmares,
All the flowers, and the candy,
All the times that you threw it back at me,
You told me you hate me, you're gonna hate me more,
When you find out, can't escape me whore.



You know a lotta girls be...thinking my songs about them, but
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...


Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say you da fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate,
Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the matt and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

Cause,



Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffin theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 

Uhh, ah yea
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money
You know who you are, I got ya

Ay yo DJ respect let’s get em
Veterans like how dare all of this arrogance
What you expect when all they do draw comparisons between us and Americans
And tell me go hard well I am going harder now 
Bumping Shawn Carter cause there aint a Shawn Carter now feel me
Get with it I’m trying to overthrow a nation using Phade To Black as a niggas only motivation
I’m picking and choosing an army and thinking of moving my talent disprove it

And if you must know this year I’m going for the gusto plus though seat feeling like a bus load
So take me as I am I have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that parade love me
I’m a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for trinity Chris word
See my role models role with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough then the whole lotto
 So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mamoses with the clique quad
What up Nikko Jordan Lucky and TJ nicknamed the night fox clique we take it easy
You prime ministers claim you repping the team I need a mother fucking president to represent me

Just the two of us.. 


Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin

Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water

And when we ride!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?

Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)

Just me and you baby
is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby

So this is it?
This is what I wished for
This isnt how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just this shit'd be different
But something changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffing it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldnt quit
I just wanted a little bit
Them it turned me to a monster 
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert
I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sowing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no one for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in between
You either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3 years later they go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just aint pass yet
A couple more years that shit'll be illmatic 
And 8 years later I'm still at it
Divorced, remarried
A felon,a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk


So be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold
I said be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might ot know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold

I got a letter from a fan that said
He's been praying for me
Everyday, and for some reason it's been weighing on my mind heavy
Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But some thing told me to go ahead and open it but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you
You didn't pray for me when i was local
And as i lay these vocals
I think of all the shit i had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you atleast a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but i've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride hasn't it?
Just watching it from an opposite stand point
Man boy's got to look... nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now on how
To describe this shit
It's just like  a vibe you get
Go ahead  and bop to it just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit

Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me

Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby

Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who"
And she like, "who are we kidding? You're 27, you just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me ,momma
What more they want from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough
Ir making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Wake up Mr. West 



Uh, Yeah, Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah



And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way,
So this is in the name of love, like Robert says
Before you ask me to get a job today, can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS,
So I guess we just pray like the minister say,
Allah o Akbar and throw em some hot cars,
Things we see on the screen are not ours,
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far,
Where im from, the dope boys is the rock stars,
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars,
I guess they want us all behind bars.
I know it.


Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)


They say people in your life are seasons,
And anything that happen is for a reason,
And niggas guns a clappin and keep to squeezin',
And Gran (Grandma) keep prayin' and keep believin',
And Jesus and one day that ya see him,
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him,
The devil is alive I feel him breathin',
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin',
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us,
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down,
Now my lil cousin smokin those cigarettes now,
His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now,
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out...
Im Stickin around....


Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

(Cuz every worthless word we get more far away, and nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

Things been so crazy and hected
I should of have got back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better any how...


So if you gotta go
If there's anythin I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you looking for a purpose


You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm all singing karaoke, further than I ever been


So if you gotta go...
If there's anyway I can help


Isn't it ironic,
That the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
And tell's me my life is to much and moves to atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you would choose some where that had somebody that you know
I'm alway's up to late
I worry bout you there alone in a place you call your home warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy cause no man wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest but the first cut is the deepest
I tryed to keep us together you was busy keeping secrets
Secrets you would tell everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money
I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm suprise you couldn't tell


I was only trying to get ahead 
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And your looking for a purpose


I was only trying to get ahead 
But the spotlight makes you nervous...

Fuck it,
Ay,
Do or Die, new arrival,
Holla at my niggas,
You survive you's alive, yo,
Now either you follow me and ride, or you's a rival.
The difference between you and I is you a model, you posing.
But who am I though?
The mulatto out for that lotto,
Money coming soon, the newest model,
Your crew is hollow,
The type of niggas got more dick, chew and swallow.
Your girl told me shoot in her face, she suicidal,
Oh shucks, you niggas is closed, you fold up.
I'm from the Ville, niggas get killed over four bucks,
Thank God we made it, my niggas, we grown up,
Now we crazy over that bread, call us the "dough-nuts," uh,
More sluts once the money blows up,
But them hoes stop if the dough drops,
I won't stop though, a chip off the 'ol block.
I'm from a city where niggas hole blocks,
Leave you looking like old socks, damn,
Cops patrol blocks, spotting on us,
The boys is rotten, I know they want us,
Probably arrest a nigga, get a bonus,
You kill a nigga, get promoted,

Shit is crazy, girls getting babies before they get diplomas,
So much I just go nuts,
Niggas telling me slow up,
Remember that,
I'm tryna get where that cheddar at,
Y'all don't hear me,
Always somebody that don't want you getting cheese, yo,
This whole bullshit is like Tom and Jerry,
I'm kinda very raw, niggas can't deny facts,
If you black they sending you to jail or Iraq,
Honor is something you can't sell or buy back,
Niggas don't like bragging, they 9-11 fly cats,
Hijack niggas, "Get up out your whip nigga, strip!
I want it all- ice on your wrists and the kicks,"
This shit happens, I ain't just rapping, believe it yo,
They got streets in the city police won't even go,
Peep it though, uh,
It ain't no secret, niggas beefing cause my ego so big,
It got me speaking like I'm diesel, like I'm devil, oh,
Niggas know my stylo, I ain't tweaking, I am lethal though,
Have your daddy looking for you,
This ain't Finding Nemo though.
Let me slow it down, dumb it down, y'all warned,
The son came up out that womb, yo, a star is born.
If real recognize real, y'all are foreign,
My team run a play on your bitch and we all scoring, yea!


Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause


They loving the crew


Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'mma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know




Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
(If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city)
TRACK 4 ON TAKE CARE

 ()
This sh-t was all I knew,
you and me only,
and I did it all for you,
still you were lonely,
we coulda worked it out,

uhh, but i guess things change,
its funny how someone elses success brings pain,
when ya no longer involved that person has it all,
and you just stuck standing there,

But, Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,
Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,


Yeah,
ever since Ive been long gone,
I traded in my senorita for a microphone,
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see,
your life is good but me and you its catastrophe,
if I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied,
I need a paramedic girl, Im feeling paralysed,
if I could choose, you will always be a friend to me,
the more money I made you acting like my enemy,
its crazy, I cant help it if you feel ashamed,
lots of pressure will turn you into my diamond babe,
how can something so familiar be so strange,
closest friends get estranged when the status change,
ahh, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at,
and my whole wild is the only one that had my back,
you were the perfect girl, now it seems we dont match,
is it the money, want me to give it back,




Uhh, i am the topic of conversation, this a celebration,
lets toast to the fact that I moved out my momma basement,
to a condo downtown because its all about location,
I sit and drink wine and watch californication of life,
you shoulda been here to kick it with me,
we coulda split this whole thing up 50/50,
but now im at the 40/40 getting b-tches tipsy,
killing sh-t the ever so talented Mr Ripley,
how I go from being the man that you argue with,
to me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest sh-t,
I should wanna go back to the one I started with,
but Im addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit,
yeah, just ask me how things are coming along,
you can tell me that you never heard none of my songs,
long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen,
cos whats a star when its most important fan is missing?

()

and a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
and i fall in love with girls caught up with superficial glamour
who dress like sarah jessica
and live like princess diana
so often they have addictions
and im the one that'll feed it
but truely you're bad enough that you dont even really need it
you can show up at the party on dirty public transit
and i guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin candids
of you and your posse partying
drinking watch you get handed
with your virgin island tans
all lookin like you just landed
i dont really understand it
im not sure im comprehending it
but these girls are having fun with whoevas money they spendin

 x2
I got to be Unstoppable

When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)


I know way too many people here right now that I didn’t know last year
who the fuck are y’all
I swear it feels like the last few nights we’ve been everywhere and back
but I just can’t remember it all
what am I doing, what am I doing
oh yeah that's right, I’m doing me, I’m doing me
I’m living life right now man
and this what I’m do til its over
til it’s over, it’s far from over


alright, bottles on me
long as I’m a drink it
never drop the ball, fuck y’all thinking
making sure the young money ship is never sinking
bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldn’t have drove, tell me how I’m getting home
you too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I’ve ever known
got to go thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
all I need is a fucking red jackets with some zippers
super good smiddoke a package of the swishas
I did it over night, it couldn’t happen any quicker
y’all know them, but fuck it me either
but point the biggest skeptic out I’ll make them a believer
it wouldn’t be the first time I’ve done it throwing hundreds
when I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ahh,




Uhhh,
one thing 'bout music when it hits you feel no pain
and I swear I got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
so they tell me that they love me I know better than that it’s just game
it’s just what comes with the flame
and I’m ready for that I’m just saying
but I really can’t complain, everything is kosher
two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
I really can’t see the end getting any closer
but I’ll probably still be the man when everything is over
so I’m riding through the city with my high beams on
can you see me can you see me get your visine on
y’all just do not fit the picture
turn your widespread on
if you thinking Imma quit before I die dream on
man they treat me like a legend
am I really this cold
I’m really too young to be felling this old
it’s about time you admit it who you kidding man
nobody’s ever done it like I did it
ahh
(chorus)

Good morning, Good Morning, Good morning, Good Morning,

Wake up Mr.West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh, Mr. By hisself he so impressed! 
I mean, Damn, did you even see the test? 
you got D's motha f***er, D's, Rosie Perez, 
and yes barely passed,
 and he in every class,
 lookin at every ass,
 cheated on every test, I guess this my dissertation,
 homie this sh*t is basic, 
welcome to graduation! 
                          
Good Morning, 
on this day we become legendary,
Everything we dreamed of,
I'm like the fly Malcolm X by any jeans necessary,
Detroit Red cleaned up,
From the streets of the league,'
from the eighth to the key,
but you graduate when you get up outta the streets
From the moment of pain,
look how far we done came, 
Haters sayin we changed, 
now ya doing ya thang,
                        
Good Morning,
Look at the validitorian,
scared of the future
while I hop In the delorian
scared to face the world 
complacement career student, 
some people graduate but we still stupid
They tell ya read this,
Eat this,
don't look around  
just peep this 
preach this,
teach this,
Jesus!
Okay look up now,'
they done stole you streetness
after all that you receive this,
      Good morning,
 
Every time that we hear em' Good Morning!
 
Get on down, Get on down, 

Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again
Soon as you get in




Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah.


I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far


I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
"Cleaning Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause, Ma,
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to Chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away it drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old,
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but




'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for "Cleaning Out My Closet", at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though,
'cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own,
But now the medications taken over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have,
'cause one thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths,
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest,
I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my mama...




I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girl
So I never say, "Goodbye, cruel world."
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die



I want a new life 

Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That being known let me know
Let me

Seems like street lights glowing
Happen to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fares
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the streetlights glowing
Happen to be
Just like moments passing
In front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fare
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

In the streets... In the streets
I'm just not there
In the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

Seems like street lights glowing
Happen to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fares
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the streetlights glowing
Happen to be
Just like moments passing
In front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fare
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the streetlights glowing
Happen to be
Just like moments passing
In front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fare
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

In the streets... In the streets
I'm just not there
In the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

(Sing about me)


When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em"
I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'm a push it, wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope -


Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it section.80, the message resemble Brenda's Got a Baby
What's crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'm a need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that "Sorry for your loss shit"
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'm a get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...


When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the cent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help me mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm sure not why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'm a rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that put me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "it need to be told
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her soul"
Exactly would have happened if I hadn't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?


Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me



(Dying of Thirst)

Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't?
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently
But they couldn't, bring her back
Who got the footage? channel 9
Cameras looking, it's hard to channel your energy
When you know you're crooked
Banana clip split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams of ballin like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst

What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world, " my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling
Backwards my mama say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"





Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And I think it's changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture, the trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagle's, an Aries coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
(Real talk) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ride around his block
All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
Welcome to Detroit, mothafucka

Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D
On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas say
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
And to think y'all hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
I had K's in front ya school, but I ain't go to Kettering
Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son
And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody

Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit

And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me
I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch
180 degrees in here trying to wait for the cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah when it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
Sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it
It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters when you came here?
And I came to kill 'em

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

What up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody
Hey Em let me get that instrumental
Take it down to the hood
Let the little hoodies get this remix crackin'
Detroit

I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks
Hit me when you done your shift
Wooh, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what?
I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky
I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me
Someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-the-strippin-shit"
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me
I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect
She's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog

Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift
I need some company
I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company

Mo City trip! Mo City trip right now!
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
A Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now

It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
Tour 'round the city, it's the shit right now
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Pop a couple percs let's get it in right now
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now
Call up your girl and put them heels on
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now
I'm on a Mo City trip
I'm a dog
I'ma dog, I'm in heat baby...heat baby
I'm a dog.....
I go ham, I'm a hog
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off
What she get in to, when we take it off
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions
Do you mind if we just menage just a little?

Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now

Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me girl why you be stressin me for time
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cuz niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me girl why you be stressin me for time
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

My inhibitions, fighting my intuition
Premature premonition
Showin me the demoliton of these phony niggas
So ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime
And checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me! BLAOOOW

Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me girl why you be stressin me for time
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a King
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

Listen
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem, and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gone snatch the crown
Look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds, one verse at a time
And claim too sick. And fuck it, if the shoe fits
Who's the king?

We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
But in reality he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize
The fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same
Are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
Cause deep down I know every poet just wanna be loved

Just the two of us.. 


Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Just the two of us.. 


Just me and you baby
is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby


Hi! My name is.. (what?) My name is.. (who?)
My name is..  Slim Shady
Hi! My name is.. (huh?) My name is.. (what?)
My name is..  Slim Shady

Ahem.. excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?


Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Ummmm..)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh! "So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!




My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Owwwwwwww!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians
In a space ship while they screaming at me: "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans (Aaahhhhhh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!'




Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive (Huh yup!)
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? (WAH!)
YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS! (WAHHH!)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (BANG!)
I'm steaming mad (Arrrggghhh!)
And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had






We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!


Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here


Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth
Cuz the people that hurt can’t understand it
You speakin outlandish, I’m ashamed how to make it all work
Another planet, it’s a short term role for me
I rec it’s all for me, it’s just mo with me
And you’re here for you too here can re-persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin off, I ain’t takin off these pistons
I’m takin off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much it’d cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a shortterm goal, no sky is the limit
I’m past that, now pass that
A word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours


I see myself performing at
Soldout shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammys, winning 5 awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Can’t imagine how it feels
That’s why I’m smiling every day
Cause my dream ain’t far away


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


You’re looking at me and tell me I’m blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I’m at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, I’m reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I’m a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow I’mma take that I’ll never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I root
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin to you, I was walkin it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello


And I’m so happy I cry
Cause I can’t believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it’s so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you play so hard
And you’ve come so far
And you go, that is the time for you to leave your more
And I’m gonna do it
Watch me


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better 

yahh,

Lyrics © Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group

Study long, study wrong, nigga 
Hey, y'all close that front door, ya'll let flies in this motherfucker 
Close that door! 
My OG up in this motherfucker right now 
My pops man with the bottle in his hand, actin' a fool 
Hey, hey, babe check it out, Imma tell you what my mama had said, she like: 

I could spot you a mile away 
I could see your insecurities written all on your face 
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say 
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang 
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same 
Circus acts only attract those that entertain 
Small talk, we know that it's all talk 
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name 

Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me 
Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me 
Say you got to burn your stash to impress me 
It's all in your head, homie 
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me 
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me 
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me 
You sound like the feds, homie 

You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie 
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
You ain't gotta try so hard 

And the world don't respect you and the culture don't accept you 
But you think it's all love 
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done 
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one 
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex) 
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex) 
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex 
Let me put it back in proper context 

What do you got to offer? 
Tell me before you we off ya, put you deep in the coffin 
Been allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit 
Instead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is 
Niggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie 
This is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts 
You can never persuade me 
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them 
Or you, the truth you love to bend 
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho 
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though 
So loud, rich niggas got low money 
And loud, broke niggas got no money 
The irony behind it is so funny 
And I seen it all this past year 
Pass on some advice we feel


Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down


Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre
The concept of school seems so securrre
Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well




Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe




I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering "where the ballas' at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it



As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me

Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab-
I just want you to do me a favor
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me...



I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
I faced her around
But his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His bridges, he out grow'd em


Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand,
Someone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm, you prick
You call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder
You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me
See he's in a whole nother weight class
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets
You're full of it; you were just in his CD's
Left at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E

I'm haunted I'm dead your gone

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oooooh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it 

 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 

(Kanye) 
Yes I did 
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib 
Just a lil somethin', show you how we live 
Everybody want it but it aint that serious 
Mhmmm thats that shit 
So if you gon do it, do it just like this 

 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 

You dont see just how wild the crowd is 
You dont see just how fly my style is 
I dont see why I need a stylist 
When I shop so much I can speak italian 
I dont know I just want it better for my kids 
And I aint sayin we was from the projects 
But everytime I wanna layaway or deposit 
My dad'll say when you see clothes, close your eyelids 
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son 
In the movie I aint talkin' bout the rich ones 
Cuz every summer 
He'll get some brand new harebrain scheme to get rich from 
And I dont know what he did for dough 
But he'll send me back to school with a new wardrobe 
and ay, ay, ay ,ay 

 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 

I think he did 
When he packed it up and brought it back to the crib 
Just a lil somethin', show you how we live 
Everything I wanted man it seemed so serious 
Mhmmm thats that shit 
So if you gon do it, do it just like this 

 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 

When it feel like living's harder than dying 
For me giving up's way harder than trying 
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion 
I wish her heart still was in rhyming 
Cuz who the kids gon' listen to 
Huh 
I guess me if it isnt you 
Last week I payed a visit to the Institute 
They got the Dropout keepin' kids in the school 
I guess i cleaned up my act like prison do 
If not for pledge at least for the principle 
They got the CD they got to see me 
Drop gems like i droped out of PE 
They used to feel invisible 
Now they now they invincible 

 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 
This is the story of a champion 
runners on their mark and they pop their guns 
Stand up stand up here he comes 
Tell me what it takes to be number 1 
Tell me what it takes to be number 1 

This is the story of a champion

oh yeah

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe

Look inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt and never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don’t know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


I’m trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I’m looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I’ll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


You ain’t heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don’t you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3′s in the air I can see you are – in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I’ll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it’s alive
My new year’s resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say – Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe

The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either crip or piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and,.. real talk, and


This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, y'know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hold up
Where you from? "How-bang"
Where you stay? "Westside", that's a piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed to cross Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the hot ninety-five, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but


This is why they fuck with me (I told you nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, y'know?


This is why they fuck with me 
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

So there you have it
But I'm a leave you with this
An OG once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I'm gone

Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
Some shit about a message you left 
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" 
This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! 
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre 
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way) 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch 

So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
We can fly over the border "Let's go" 
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
 (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri 
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste 
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Plus he raps with his regular voice 
 (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys 
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ 
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! 
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
Do somethin'! At least one punchline 
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs 
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither 
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!) 
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', ain't no tellin'

Suitcase, I been livin' out a suitcase
Still drinkin' Henny, if it's done, I'll take the D'usse
Oops, aye, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
True say, I been goin' hard, but then again
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in, man
I got a blunt, can I get a light?
Yeah, I took the summer off to get it right
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Niggas like "you took the summer off? we couldn't tell"
Dawg, just bought a island, gotta sail to it
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it somebody gotta do it
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it

Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
The shit was gettin' too predictable
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah
I mean we hear about the money you been gettin'
We just never seen a visual
It's our year (aw yeah), Aw yeah
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)
What's the word these days?
Buncha' niggas chasing after all these woman they don't even know (WOOO)
Buncha' out of season woman
Fuckin' off-season niggas to get last season wardrobe (WOOO)
All the rappers that you vouch for
Need to get out of the house more, they washed up
And even if the team was religious with it
I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, naw (WOOO)

OVO, Unruly
One shot to make it in a life
From the six to the fucking 876

I gotta keep watchin' for oppers 'case anything's possible, yeah
There's no code or ethics out here, anyone will take shots at you, yeah
Niggas think they can come take what I got, let's be logical, yeah
V-Live, I order that Alfredo pasta then eat in the kitchen like i'm in the mafia
Houston, they get me though

How much it hit me fo'?
Ain't no tellin', yeah

Ain't no tellin'
Please don't speak to me like I'm that Drake from four years ago

Thinkin' they lions and tigers and bears, I go huntin'
Put heads on my fire place, oh my
Take time, ain't no tellin'
Oh my, ain't no tellin'

Oh oh oho.
damn, here we go again.
Oh oh oho.
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam,

now everything I'm not, made me everything I am.
damn, here we go again.
people talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am.

I never be picture-perfect-Beyonce
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet
He was as black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as his beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.am
Let me know if you feel it man
'cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

and I'm back to tear it up
haters, start your engines
I hear 'em gearin' up
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops
they forget to get their haircut
OK fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
baggy clothes, Reebok's, or Adidas
can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
so say goodbye to the NAACP award
goodbye to the India.Arie award
they'd rather give me the nigga-please award
but I'll just take the I-got-a-lot-of-cheese award

damn, here we go again.
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I know that people wouldn't usually rap this
but I got the facts to back this
just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
man, killing's some wack shit
oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
he got changed over his chains, a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
the church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
the slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay
my 15 seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today

damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am 

The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
And turned to the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossin' the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts and get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights, cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me cause I love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide
It's just physics, please let's put our egos aside
You my niggas, and should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said son
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track

Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God
Nigga Cole the God
January 28th 

Drake]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got sh*t on what you're feeling now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man
Yeah I said it, B*tch I'm the man
Don't you forget it

The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in the speaker right now: that's me
And the voice in the mirror, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted, with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason that you always getting faded

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me

Ok look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things

It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of "Mr Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me


May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you
And heaven accept you..

Ooww Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you’ve all been waiting for ..
In this corner : weighing 175 pounds,
with a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,
the undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world :
Slim Shady!

 : Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don’t act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh Uh-oh, bitch3s hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where’s the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I notice there’s so many of them
and there’s really not that many of us.
And ladies love us, my posse’s kicking up dust.
It’s on till the break of dawn
and we’re starting this party from dusk

Ok … let’s go

Eminem
Back wit Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you’ll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the fumunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
Its a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed.
Bitch3s lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us. Its ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the sh-t
gets worse then worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
Its elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say we're the center of attention its true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here’s the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio’s back on you hoes.

 : Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don’t act like a snobby model.
You just hit the lotto.
Uh-oh Uh-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

Dr Dre
They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain’t got to tell me why you’re sick cuz I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.
I’m an itch that they cant scratch, they sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cuz over and above all, its just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I’ll be dammed, just f*cked around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end
Lets cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know.
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision.
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

Bring the shaun dawn burn marajauan do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what

I spend it like it don’t mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherf*cker i’m grown

Fat ass burgundy bags classy sh-t Jimmy Cho shoes
I say move a bitch move

{verse 1}
all niqht i've, been starin'
can you tell i want you ?
can't be too, wide open
but there's nothin, i won't do
ohhh... just want  you to know

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

{verse 2}
I wish i... wasn't famous
I wish i... was still in school
So that i can have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you crazy

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious


{fadey fade away.... lls .}


Yesterday when we were getting high
you were invited, you woulda liked it
uh uh ah, I know you all too well
we said that we can kiss the past goodbye
but your weren't excited
there's no way to fight it
you can stay shawty but here I go


Should I spend the weekend in Vegas
I'm busy living the moment not taking pictures to save it
I mean how could I forget
my memories never faded I can't relate to these haters
my enemies never made it
I am... still here with who I started with
the game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr sh-t
carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship
yeah, I'm 23 with a money tree
growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist and thats how she met my pops
and now my garden is enormous, it's happening penny lane
I said its happening Penny Lane
just like you said I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead
uh ahh, thats word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough!


What am I afraid of
this is what dreams are supposed to made of
the people I don't have time to hang with
always look at me and say the same sh-t

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh



Am I wrong for making light of my situation
clap on when 40 got something for me to snap on
NOw that I'm on I dont want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on
get my f-cking buffett on
I heard they jsut moved my grandmother to a nursing home
and I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
but hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
that I barely know at all and
plus this women that I mess with unprotected txt us saying she wish she woulda kept it
the one I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
I couldn't tell you where the f-ck head is
I'm holding on by a thread its like I'm high right now
the guy right now and you can tell by looking at my eyes right now
that nothing really comes as a surprise right now
cause we having the time of our lives right now




I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
the other day Lissa told me she missed the old me
which made me question when I went missing
and when I start treating my friends different
maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the 2 guns in my face during the stick up
maybe cause I girl I f-cking trusted set the whole sh-t up
but a fact I have'nt seen 'em since they locked big Rich up
I know, the same time, I'm quick to forget
bout to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets
burn it al burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
cause half the itme I got it right I probably guessed
did I just trade free time for camera time
will I blow all of this money baby, hammertime
yeah, I just need some closure, aint no turning back for me
I'm in it till it's over

In the night I hear `em talk
the Coldest story  ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless (ya-a-a)
How could you be so heartless?(y-a-a)Oh
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo I know some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo I did some things but that's the old me
and now you wanna get me back 
and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend,
Well I got homies
but in the end it`s still so lonely

In the night I hear `em talk
the coldest story  ever told 
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless(ya-a-a)
How could you be so heartless?(ya-a-a)Oh
How could you be so heartless

How could you be so Dr.Evil 
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we were'nt gon' speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me fo`
Homie I don't know 
She's hot and cold
I won't stop i won`t mess my groove up 
'Cause I already know how this thing goes
You run and tell your friends that your leavin' me 
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see  
 you'll never find nobody better than me

In the night I hear `em talk
The coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless(ya-a-a)
How could you be so heart less?(ya-a-a)Oh
How could you be so heartless?

Talkin', talkin', talkin' talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we've been through 
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I've got something new to see
And you just keep on hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
 I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong?
And you can`t make it right 
I'm gon' take off tonight 
Into the night

I hear `em talk
The coldest story  ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless(ya-a-a)
How could you be so heartless?Oh
How could you be so heartless?

Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love,
Cause I don't have the time for that
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where it's at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract

I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggaz for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch

And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

Are we havin is sex tonight?
Ladies say, I ain't have sex in a long time
I a'int have sex in a long ass time
Baby, I ain't have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight, sex tonight

Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100 nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'

Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

 Hailie

Look at what the fuck you dun got into
I see you found your nitch you're just a bitch with a menstral
Claiming you a murderer and spelt it wrong
You put the "E" before the "D" because that's all you on
You on Pac's dick (bitch) you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins 3 deals that another nigga got you they didn't see

And Ja Rule be praying on his cover cause he need it
And you niggas hating shut your mouths
It's just the real niggas ain't buying that shit you put out


Doe Rae Me but we don't sing motherfuckers
So Murder Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team who expects nothing less then R 'n' B coming from that regime
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream
Now that you embrace the green don't fuck with the triple beams
You're a motherfucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen?
Artists with repituares saw him in action, Pac's assassination
Def jam grabbed him, told him reenact him you'll go platinum
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins
Reenacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in Detroit motherfucker

Now we can skip past the mean mugs, get to the slugs
To grievance and the crying and intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga you shook,
You're half of a half-way crook nigga get off X dick go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one and when your gone you'll only be the late fake
one
Nigga please stick the script before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch, fucking old ass ignorant innocent looking senior citizen
Built up slap you like renaissance sicitive wait a minute hold on
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch made man now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holla and curse and go ahead and respond
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse


Slim set an impulse to get at the wanktas
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the drama for stucky and bush stones
What's wrong? didn't think were strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
This real witness you all ain't caught the concept
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source
Threatening at the boss you're gonna see me on your porch
Now I've got the nerve to try serve on us
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust


Do I gotta get my nigga bugs, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Caddillac, Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat
You not Pac's songs without laws will help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your "mock"avelli get your own identity


Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da

Don't play me cause you're washed up, lost your spot

Going at me is the only shot you got

Shady Records, what you know about?
Fuck Benzino, fuck Ja Rule
Nigga, this is Obie Trice right here talking to you mother fuckers
Ja Rule punk ass yeah
Fuck his soul for real ass
Nigga that's soul, that's the nigga from 'soul for real'
Candy rain ass nigga you got a deal now you rapping
You don't know us, fagot ass mother fuckers
Give money to all my real niggas
Obie Trice, D12, G-Unit, 50 Cent, Hailie Jade Hahahaha

 Daddy is Ja Rule taller than me?

 No honey you guys are the same size

Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it wrenched
But now I see my nigga
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah can I get a glimpse?

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Keep on blamin' nigga that ain't never had things
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shits not always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know
How could you know? How could you know?

Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And thats the key my nigga
Listen up I'm bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in the fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, thats what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you nigga

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not, last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Father forgive me for me, childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me, miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but
Before you go I've got to, warn you now
Whatever goes up surely, must come down
And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command


Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great then I falls, my insides crawl
and I clam up (wham) I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road


I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road


I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, and the same pants
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road




You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't the skillest
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each on of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road



I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous a**
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your a**
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that s*** you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light


Fuck dat
8 doobies to the face
Fuck dat
12 bottles in the case
Nigga, fuck dat
2 pills and a half, wait
Nigga, fuck dat
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist


Man, I swear
My nigga trippin off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him vicodin
Hope to take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of section 8
And you feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are
A loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins
Make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin off
My generation sippin cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition
That the world is bout to end
Who gives a fuck? we never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
A melody and some hoes
Playstation and some drank
Technology bumping Soul
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd, that's product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black
She black too
Purple label on her back
But that dap
Is like when she take it straight to the head
Then she look at me
She got AD-HD




Like woah oh oh woah (x4)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(They always told me ad-hd did it)


And then she started
And then she started
Feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
Beg you pardon
Oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23
Ok then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said where my drink at?
I'mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors
Have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds
Closed the screen, jumbotron
Made it to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it
Then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That ADHD crazy






You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six
Just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, dro, hoes
Whatever you like
You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light

On lonely nights I start to fade(x2)

Her loves a thousand miles away(x2)

Memories made in the coldest winter, goodbye my friend, will I eva love again

Memories made in the coldest winter....

It's 4 am and I can't sleep(x2)

Her love is all that I can see(x2)

Memories made in the coldest winter, goodbye my friend , will I eva love again

Memories made in the coldest winter....

Winter(x2)

Goodbye my friend, will I eva love again(x3)

It's rain can't take the snow away(x2)

It melt away all our mistakes(x2)

Memories made in the coldest winter, goodbye my friend, I won't eva love again

Neva again....


I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25 sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?


One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt?
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

 

Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your motherfucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?, cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6

 1:
Aiyyo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, cause they be actin maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming pills or roaches, we sprayed and disinfects
and twist the necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass in a track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
I'm Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

 2:
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, some fruit to stomp,and then two feet to rinse
I greet intensive ladies, I spoil all your fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the only one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My a capella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

 3:
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility 
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tractical, tactful, track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
I'm Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite(x2)

What money got to do with it 
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image? 
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it 
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit 
Hol' up 
Get it back 
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it 
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what? 

If I was the president 
I'd pay my mama's rent 
Free my homies and them 
Bulletproof my Chevy doors 
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord 
Who ever thought? 
Master take the chains off me 

Life can be like a box of chocolate 
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious 
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it 
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive 
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics 
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant 
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious 
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges 
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is 
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it 
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this 
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal 
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god 
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged 
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards 
You lookin' at artists like the harvests 
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them 
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry 
I should've listened what my grandmama said to me 

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga 
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass 
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga 
Oh now, slow down 

And once upon a time in a city so divine 
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid 
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said 

What I'm s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks? 
The convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips 
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor 
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for 
Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this? 
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist 
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it 
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds? 
No more livin' poor, meet my .44 
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor 
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers 
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey 
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay 
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA 
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor? 
Well that's me at these awards 
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy 
She said... 

And once upon a time in a city so divine 
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused 
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse 
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie 
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey 
Hollywood's nervous 
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service

You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you're the f-cking coldest
Intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they aint got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking somes d-cks until some millions appear
Voila! you do it right he might just buy you a car
Unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre
Independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer
Make it rain finger (check)
M3 beamer (check)
Champagne range
Triple white Caddy
Closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and BeBe

Who f-ck for bowls of baked ziti

Uh, 5 and a half in boys
Ass is off the hook
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never
But never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever
You just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas
And enough money to loan us a little something extra
Should we ever need it
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it

Oh you fancy huh

Need y'all niggas to feel me yo,
Feel my pain...
Said soft niggas can't last hard times yo,
Believe that shit.
Real niggas don't cry...
Look,
Yo...

Was just a youngin' with that fresh fade,
Bird chest, legs skinny,
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny,
Fresh pennies on my feet,
Momma paid for everything I'm wearing,
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world.
Aw. nigga, but shit done changed since "Mayne" was my nickname,
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game,
Now I'm a man worried about my fam'
Let me explain,
Its like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shits sprained.
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle,
Feeling like the world's on your back so you stumble,
And it feels like a quarterback get sacked, and then you fumble.
Jobs don't call a nigga back so it's back to the hustle.
Niggas praying for they moms,
At the same time they moms pray for them.
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way,
But damn a nigga been a lost fate.
It hurts on the usual,
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral.

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.

I sit back and watch the news every now and then,
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash,
Even the weathers bad.
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted,
Like damn it's '06 and niggas still up on that gang shit?
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split
Only seventeen, he was finna graduate in like three weeks,
some stupid niggas got him for his chain,
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped,
Some dude snatched her and she was standing at the bus stop, wait,
man she just eleven!
What the fuck is up with this world,
got these grown niggas fucking with girls?
Plus the cops harassing us,
every week be blasting us, on accident, or so they claim
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain
They killed her only son,
Make her wanna blow her brains out,
Change the channel man I can't watch this shit...

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.

Take a ride through the city man and tell me what you witness.
Poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits,
violence, hatred, real devastation,
neighborhoods looking like there's still segregation,
welfare, single mothers, no jobs,
tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie,
fiegns in the street so high off of that crack shit,
this nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress...
White folks got the road to success mapped and that's all good,
but why don't black's got that same atlas?
I asked the same question a million ways
and it seems like I had prayed for a million days.
Still the ills remain - just bills and pain.
Shoot outs and project buildings, children slain,
skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why.
Its enough to make a nigga wanna cry,
but I can't though...

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.

First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant I'ma be a better you
Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville
For Phil, Listen even back when we was broke my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory
I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches bitches so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark skinned and Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out of touch with reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
Fuck em' then we kick em' to the door
Nigga you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave
I'ma need my shirt back
Nigga you know how it go

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably in Tennessee that says fool me once, shame on - shame on you.
If you fool me we can't get fooled again

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

We don't hunt deer
Vegetarian dishes from the concierge
Presidential suites, presidential treats
Brazilian models, oilin' up my feet
10 days a month, my girl pays for lunch
3 days a week, we work out at Crunch
Time after time, line after line
Our stock increases, rhyme after rhyme
In the valley, of San Fernando
Found Q-Tip's wallet in El Segundo
Prolly been spotted on Telemundo
With more wild cards than a box of Uno
That spin like propeller, my dog like Old Yeller
Holler at the moon, my goons at Coachella




I got my hands in the pot, 500 grand in the yacht
I'm the dope man with plans to expand on every block
Wu-brand, legendary hands, hard as penitentiary rock
Now put that to your temple, the Wu symbol's 'bout to drop
Insert the beam on my Glock, got that lean in my bottle
What that mean? High self esteem, straight cream on the top
Ridin' chops similar to UFC kickbox, kick rocks
Dirty trucker pit stops, shit, grams in a Ziploc
Watch how the pitbull lock his jaws, then lock your doors
Feds watch the boards, hip hop spills out my pores
I be raw, 4 plus 4, but 7 more
The Clan rock the tours, we be them reservoir dogs


Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier


Guaranteed I bang hard
I plan to leave the game large, no brainwash
The devil himself could not persuade God, my blade's sharp
Circle my square, I dare you Braveheart
Before I leave your head in your hands, what's your name, huh?
My lines get in your cells like 7 Ls
Any problem, I address you like I'm sendin' you mail
Let me do well, they'd rather see me dead or in jail
But let it be my life story if they ever do tell
Know I died for what I live
An intimate connection for that infinite reflection
That's my wife and my kids, there's a price on my lid
So now my stock's high and shots fired
My niggas who was tight with the kid
I'm hot as Hell's Kitchen with the oven on
Deck bomb, teflon the rappers nothin' to a don
If I'm frontin' then respond
If not, throw up your arms, it's the Killer Bee swarm
And your set, the fuck is y'all?


You enterin' the 36, masterin' the 18
 chamber sixth, hands down, I crush bricks
Backs that'll break bats, this is what y'all wanted back
Classic Wu RZA track with mathematic actual facts
That weigh heavy, the universal strikin' attack
Dance the drunken medley, long axe blade, machete
The shallow steppin' ninja



(with Big Sean, Pusha T & 2 Chainz)


Well
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth

Built a house up on that ass, that's an ass state
Roll my weed on it, that's an ass tray
Say Ye, say Ye, don't we do this err' day-day?

Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
And niggas still hatin', so much hate I need an AK
Now we out in Paris, yeah I'm Perrierin'
White girls politicin' that's that Sarah Palin
Gettin' high, Californicatin'

All she want is some heel money

He take his time, he counts it out

Check the neck, check the wrist
Them heads turnin', that's exorcist
My Audemar like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time and that's excellence
Two door preference
Roof gone George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake
So your Duncan Heinz is irrelevant

Wherever we go we do it pronto

In the dance hall, and who no have teeth will run pon them gums
Caw when time it comes to my sound, which is the champion sound
The bugle has blown the many times, and it still have one more time left
Caw the amount of stripe weh deh pon our shoulder


Let the suicide doors up
I do suicides on the tour bus
I do suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam building like I'm the shit
Tell 'em "Give me fifty million or I'm a quit"
Most rappers taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up in your face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press, kid
Plus your my bitch, make your bitch look like Precious
Something' 'bout Mary she gone off that Molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I move in the lobby
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon see lawyers and niggas in Jordans


Now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane
Spit rounds like the gun range
Beat it up like Rampage
100 bands, cut your girl, now your girl need a band aid
Grade A, A1,
Chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds backpack around me
Cosigned by Louis Vuitton
Horse power, horse power
All this Polo on I got horse power
Pound of this cost 4 thousand

Rain pourin',

As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me

Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab-
I just want you to do me a favor
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me...

We got a young brother to stand for something! 
We got a young brother that believe in the all of us! 
Brother Kendrick Lamar! He's not a rapper, he's a writer, he's an author! 
And if you read between the lines, we'll learn how to love one another! But you can't do that 
Right on 
I said, you can't do that - without loving yourself first 

I done been through a whole lot 
Trial, tribulations, but I know God 
Satan wanna put me in a bow-tie 
Praying that the holy water don't go dry, yeah yeah 
As I look around me 
So many motherfuckers wanna down me 
But ain't no nigga never drown me 
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

Everybody looking at you crazy (Crazy) 
What you gone do? (What you gone do?) 
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving) 
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you) 
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart 
On my sleeve let the runway start 
You know the miserable do love company 
What do you want from me and my scars? 
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence 
How many times our potential was anonymous? 
How many times the city making me promises? 
So I promise this 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street 
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police 
And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends 
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme, yup 
These days of frustration keep y'all on ducking rotation 
I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum basis 
Dreams of realities peace 
Blow steam in the face of the beast 
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now 
The strong in me, I still smile 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

Walk my barefeet (Walk my barefeet) 
Down, down valley peak (Down, down valley peak) 
I keep my fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum) 
I keep my heart undone (My heart undone) 

And I love myself 
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) 
I love myself 
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind) 
I love myself 
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) 
I love myself 
(One day at the time, sun gone shine) 

I went to war last night 
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic 
I'm a do it 'til I get it right 
I went to war last night 
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent 
Duckin' every other blessin', l can never see the message 
I can never take the lead, I can never bob and weave 
For my nigga that be letting 'em annihilate me 
And the sound is moving in a meteor speed 
From a 100 to a billion lay my body in the street 
Keep my money in the ceiling let my mama know I'm free 
Give my story to the children and the lesson they can read 
And the glory to the feeling of the only unseen 
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!" 

I lost my head, I must've misread what the good book said 
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside 
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry



I was born with a dick in my brain
Yea fucked in the head
My step-father said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
"Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?"
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said, 
"I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid"
The bastard won't even eat nothing he scared
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead
Debby don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there stick a fucking cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's faking it
I bet you, I'll bet he prolly wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course unless you object
Ah, go fuck his brains out if any is left in his head



If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane



You get it? No I just tried to bite my face off
I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw bit the fucking blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop
Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like king kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he layed all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants he took every fucking thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yea, maniac that Shady dog
Man that motherfuckers gangsta, ain't he dog?
Shady dog, what be going through that fucking brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waiting for? Sing along.




Don't you know what felch means? (Yea)
Well then tell me, would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp belch and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying man? can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my step-father felt me
Fuck a little puppet kick the puppy while he's yelping
Shady what the fuck you saying? I don't know help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fucking melting!
Marshall I just love you boy I care about your well-being
No dad I said no, I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy I can do it by myself see
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it Pubic Hair on Chelsey
Well this is called Ass-Rape and we're shooting the Jail scene






I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I...
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real 


I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself




I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they mow that's green
I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you love me
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and their present is old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?




The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word "but", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real


"... I ain't trippin' off that Dominos anymore, just calling, sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did homie". "Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga". "Realness is responsibility, realness is taking care of your motherfucking family, realness is god, nigga"




"Alright that's all I wanted to tell you, just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom."

"Boy you better have my jawn on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't tripping. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by the food for less, and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take this music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago you know that's what we do."


Sing my song, it's all for you 


"If I don't hear from you, by tomorrow... I hope you come back, and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back, with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? talk to you later, bye."




Yeah boy,
better ring the alarm boy,
dem know its coming boy,


Oh my God, f-cking Bomboclat
I’m hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire,
tie a whore up with barbed wire, nothing but a broad boy,
I’m the real deal, and char-broiler on the bonfire

f-cking fictitional characters and fariytales,
prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris Wheels,
but it aint fiction its fact boy beware its real
them lyrics you wield equals zero to a hero’s shield
Mr fly by the seat of his pants parasail
or hit the trampoline bounce and grab a pair of stilts,
and I aint wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no nada,

Drop the bomb on em,

Drop the bomb on em

yeah boy you know we about to put it down for ya,
so kick your shoes off,

and siyanara see ya f-ckers tommorow,

and have a coke and a smile, dont make me open a jar,

yeah you fresher than most boy, I’m just doper than all boy,
I’m that boy boy, them boys them no up to par
I just show up go up to the stage and blow up the spot,

Holten in this B-tch, Im the Proof boy your a fraud,
I destroy you boy, f-ck around and blow ya to Sod
oh my God boy, you didn’t go there, no you did not,
I got a whole story board for you, boy your da plot,

apology not accepted boy, Detroit is a rock,
we get to beefing, aint no telling at what point it will stop,
all I got to do is point to the spot,
when the bomb drops boy does it drop,
and when it does boy there’s a problem,




Boy dont jinx yourself,
boy I’m Michael Spinks with the belt,
Stringer bell boy, my name rings bells for itself,
I’m sick as hell boy,

Bringin hell boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
and to that boy who done said it …,
who said he was better,
lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
i bet he never seen Freddie in a Black and red little sweater,
back better than ever,
the chedder shredder the grater the beef grinder
I’ll settle vendettas a little later,
giving haters incubators, think ya made a mistake,
by saying Shady was ghost, I ain’t even close to the gate

Im bout to turn this f-cking place to Beirut in a day
so hey wouldn’t you say Im the sh-t,
couldn’t agree with you more if you were to say my f-cking sh-t doesn’t stink,

Lyrics © Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group

That's what they doin', Cameron, they actin' like these singers, man.
I ain't goin' to the studio until I got a situation.
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer.
Who gonna be on the hook?
Man, what is you doin'?
Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!

Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though
Voice mail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, "nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, "the first mill gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work

Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)

Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man

Hear What?
Yo hear what, tek time
(Laughing)
Ahh, no shit!
Yo hear what?
Wa gwan ...
Yo him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van you know Drizzy

Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing

I do better with the rider in my system
Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we

Yeah, yeah, oh, you gotta love it
Oh, you got, oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried
It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual, my career's like a "how to "manual
So I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we have words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to R.I.P. about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But man, oh, you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it

Hello
Yeah I just walked in
Yeah I'm good you still working?
Tonight, right now?
'Did I go out' yeah I went out
I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed
Shit... wine or water
You said something about a cold drink
I don't know, I'm delirious... night


Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy

But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
"F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing thats so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say

F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin' 'bout bitches
That we almost had
I don't think I'm concious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeh we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeh, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women thats living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on


Well I'm sorry" -- Drake
Are you drunk right now? -- Woman

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me


You're not going to come?
Guess i'm bout to just kick it here then...

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Drizzy,
Oh yeah Trey I fucking feel you,
They be staring at the money like it's unfamiliar,
I get it,
I live it,
To me there's nothings realer,
Just enough to solve your problems,
Too much would kill ya,
And when I leave,
I always come right back here,
The young spit it and everybody in rap fear,
A lot of ya'll still sounding like last year,
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier,
Nickels for my thoughts,
Dimes in my bed,
Quarters of the kush,
Ain't the limes in my head,
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD,
Yeah,
I want it all,
That's why I strive for it,
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it,
I know what's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Yeah,
I want things to go my way,
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,
And my mother tried to runaway from home,
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway,
And she cried to me so I cried too,
And my stomach was soaking wet,
She only 5'2,
And 48 hours all before I showed up,
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
Damn my reality just set in,
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
I do a lot of things,
Hoping I never have to fit in,
So trying to keep up with my programs is like a dead end,
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
And life change for us every single week,
So what's good,
But I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.


Wise words from a decent man,
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand,
This lost boy got fly without peter pan,
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,
In person I am everything and more,
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,
Just call me shop and bag drizzy,
And call me Mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy,
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad,
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
To big homie use a flash if you must,
And I swear I ain't asking for much
All I want is


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

It's like I know what I got to say,
I just don't know how to say it to you


Pardon the swag,
But bitches cartate,
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,
How come I can't,
Miss a woman like I can't miss cartdates,
Cheese,
But shes not in this portrait,
Life's fine but I don not portray,
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
I don't want the glow,
I want the glow ray,
And I'm a fuck the world,
But this is just foreplay,
Tired of hearing bullshit,
Bring her on to cowshit,
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than ? shit,
That's word to toronto,
So high up I got birds in the condo,
Ain't that a female dog,
Ask her who I am to her,
And she yell god,
Weezy baby go ? hard,
No further details boy.

Drake] 
I am on a 24 hour champagne diet

Ballin out we keep the cash on deck 
Lamborghini and the Bentleys on the V-set 
Louie lens iced out with the black diamonds

()

Alls my life I has to fight, nigga 
Alls my life I... 
Hard times like God 
Bad trips like: "God!" 
Nazareth, I'm fucked up 
Homie you fucked up 
But if God got us we then gon' be alright 

 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
We gon' be alright 
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
Huh? We gon' be alright 
Nigga, we gon' be alright 
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright 

Uh, and when I wake up 
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut 
Behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down 
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down 
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life 
Painkillers only put me in the twilight 
What pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight 
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like 
Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy 
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow 
So my karma come and Heaven no preliminary hearing 
So my record and my motherfucking gang can stand in silence for the record 
Tell the world I know it's too late 
The hoes, the girls think I gone crazy 
Try and fight my vices all day 
Won't you please believe when I say 

When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga 
When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?" 
And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga 
I'm at the preacher's door 
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright 

What you want, a house or a car 
40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar 
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog 
Motherfucker you can live at the mall 
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know when it's illegal 
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero 
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal 
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you 
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you 
In the presence of your chico... ah! 
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool 
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you 
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog thats all 
Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all 
I rap, I'm black, on track and rest assured 
My rights, my wrongs are right till I'm right with God 

I keep my head up high 
I cross my heart and hope to die 
Lovin' me is complicated 
Too afraid, a lot of changes 
I'm alright and you're a favorite 
Dark nights in my prayers 

I remembered you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room 
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went runnin' for answers

What's wrong nigga? 
I thought you was keeping it gangsta? 
I thought this what you wanted? 
They say if you scared go to church 
But remember 
He knows the bible too 

My baby when I get you get you get you get you 
Ima go head to ride with you 
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you 
Cause I (want you) 
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty 
Registration is out of service 
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving 
Cause I (want you) 
I want you more than you know 

I remember you took me to the mall last week baby 
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times 
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified 
That I (want you) 
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy 
I said you crazy 
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you) 

You said to me 
You said your name was Lucy 
I said where's Ricardo? 
I said oh no, not the show 
Than you spit a little rap to me like this 
When I turned 26 I was like oh shit 
You said this to me 
I remember what you said too you said 
My name is Lucy Kendrick 
You introduced me Kendrick 
Usually I don’t do this 
But I see you and me Kendrick 
Lucy Give you no worries 
Lucy got million stories 
About these rappers I came after when they was boring 
Lucy gone fill your pockets 
Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton 
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised 
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty 
Avoiding me? 
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly 
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute 
Lucy work harder 
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father 
I'm Lucy 
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly 
Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me 
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front 
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work 
I want you to know that Lucy got you 
All your life I watched you 
And now you all grown up then sign this contract if that’s possible 

I remembered you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room 
I didn't wanna self destruct 
The evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went runnin' for answers 
Until I came home

Study long, study wrong, nigga 
Hey, y'all close that front door, ya'll let flies in this motherfucker 
Close that door! 
My OG up in this motherfucker right now 
My pops man with the bottle in his hand, actin' a fool 
Hey, hey, babe check it out, Imma tell you what my mama had said, she like: 

I could spot you a mile away 
I could see your insecurities written all on your face 
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say 
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang 
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same 
Circus acts only attract those that entertain 
Small talk, we know that it's all talk 
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name 

Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me 
Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me 
Say you got to burn your stash to impress me 
It's all in your head, homie 
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me 
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me 
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me 
You sound like the feds, homie 

You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie 
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga 
You ain't gotta try so hard 

And the world don't respect you and the culture don't accept you 
But you think it's all love 
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done 
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one 
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex) 
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex) 
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex 
Let me put it back in proper context 

What do you got to offer? 
Tell me before you we off ya, put you deep in the coffin 
Been allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit 
Instead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is 
Niggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie 
This is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts 
You can never persuade me 
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them 
Or you, the truth you love to bend 
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho 
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though 
So loud, rich niggas got low money 
And loud, broke niggas got no money 
The irony behind it is so funny 
And I seen it all this past year 
Pass on some advice we feel

(Intro) 

Yeah, can't stop now... 
This maybe the last chance I get, to be famous 

(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 1) 

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist, they call me Slim Rothelsberger 
I get beserker than a fed up post office worker 
A murker with a mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered 
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter 
For a gangsta, you should of shit your pants when you saw 
The chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel 
I faced her around when his fangs come out, get your brains blown out 
That's what I call blowing your mind, when I come back like nut on your spine 
I'm a thumbtac that you slept on son 
Now here I come screaming "attack" like I just stepped on one! 
Lowering the totem til' he showed 'em, defiance, giant scrotum 
He don't owe them bitches shit, his bridges, he out wrote 'em 
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the south pole and 
Nobody fucks with him, rigamortis and post-mortem 
He's dying of boredom, take your best rhymes, record 'em 
Then try to thwart him, he'll take your punchlines and snort 'em 
Shit stained drawers, you gon' fuck with the guy that licks the blades of his chainsaws 
While he dips 'em in P.F. chang's sauce 
Game's off homie, hang it up like some crank calls 
You think I'm backing down, you must be out your dang skulls! 
I'm almost famous 


(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 2) 

I'm back for revenge, I lost the battle, that ain't happening again 
I'm at your throat like strep, I step strapped with a pen 
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are distorting my mem-ory 
Some are wrote on a napkin, do what I have to to win 
Pulling out all stops, any who touch a mic prior 
Is not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers 
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the whacko 'for 
I take a shit in his jackolantern then smash it on his porch 
Now get off my dick, dick's too short of a word for my dick 
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism you prick! 
Don't call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer 
I just blew up the challenger, matter of fact, I need a lawyer 
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast 
Beat his ass naked and pee'd in his corner like Verne Troyer 
Ya'll are Eminem backwards, you're menime's 
See he's in a-whole-nother weight class, his slugs your BB's 
Your bean bag bullets, you're full of it, you were dissing his CD's 
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheeties 
No peace treaty's, he's turned into a beast 
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the might DRE 
He's almost famous 

(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

( 3) 

Now there he goes, in Dre's studio, cupping his balls 
Screaming the wood off the panelling, cussing the paint off the walls 
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads 
He ain't giving 'em shit, he's scissor pinch a penny so hard 
He'll leave a bruise on the brawn so dark 
You can see the mark when it scars, til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out "AHHH!" 
His metaphors and similies ain't similar to them not at all 
If they don't like they can all get fucked, instead of sucking him off 
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by 
Like David Carridy, they can go fuck themselves and just die 
And eat shit while they at it, he's fucking had it 
He's mad at the whole world, so go to hell and build a snowman, girl 
The bullies become bullied, the pussies get pushed 
They better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me 
Cause I ain't looking back only forward, this whole spot blowing 
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it 
And while I'm being poetic, let me get a stork 
And raise the bar higher than my opinion of these women ? 
So bare witness to some biblical shit 
As the cold wind blowing, this world ain't gonna know what hit it, he did it, he made it, he's finally famous!

How much a dollar really cost? 
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts 
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, y'all 
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car 
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo 
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 
20 years ago, can't forget 
Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals 
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do 
20 on 6, he didn't hear me 
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu 
My American tongue was slurry 
Walked out the gas station 
A homeless man with a silly tan complexion 
Asked me for ten grand 
Stressin' about dry land 
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open 
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' 
He begged and pleaded 
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it 
Told him, "Beat it" 
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it 

Listen to me, I want a single bill from you 
Nothin' less, nothin' more 
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door 
Tell me how much a dollar cost 

It's more to feed your mind 
Water, sun and love, the one you love 
All you need, the air you breathe 

He's starin' at me in disbelief 
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key 
He's starin' at me, I started my car and tried to leave 
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see 
A reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him 
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor 
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser 
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious 
Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect 
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck 
I never understood someone beggin' for goods 
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could 
And this particular person just had it down pat 
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked 
Have you ever opened to Exodus 14? 
A humble man is all that we ever need 
Tell me how much a dollar cost 

Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment 
I never met a transient that demanded attention 
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' 
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different 
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless 
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? 
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies 
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time 
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin' 
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise 
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine 
Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin 
Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin' 
Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal 
Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up 
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus 
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy 
You looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet" 
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep" 
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free 
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power 
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve 
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost 
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God" 

I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me? 
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be 
Shades of grey will never change if I condone 
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs

This is why I do this shit.

I think they call this, uhm, venting.

 1:

Look
Uhh.

This is me.
Still the same.
They want the hits.
I play the game.
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.
It all comes spilling out like i hit a vein.
Watt up lil Braw.
Watt up slum Ville.
I hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still.
The fans thinking that we all signed for one meal.
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.
That aint how it works.
That aint that how it goes.
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.
And I could use a writer to balance out my flows.
But I never share my thoughts,
This is all a nigga knows.
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised.
And I would be performing just as long as Im alive.
So every word I utter will be mine.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
Oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

 2:
I never cried when Pac died.
But I probably will when Hov does.
And if my tears hold value, then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us.
And Ill be standing in a puddle.
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.
And ima keep it honest.
Am so tired of being subtle.
Its just me, Forty, O, and nich standing in a huddle.
Staring at the members of my team.
Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme.
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.
I hope you tell your family this shit aint what it seems.
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.
And know I pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions.
At least I put it all in the open.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

 3:
Look.
Fuck all yall.
We ignore feelin's here.
Premature millionaires.
Welcome to my realest year.
Yeah.
I swear we making a killah here.
I should be on top of the world here just chillen here.
Uh.
But its funny having fans.
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance, and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit dont feel the same.
Yeah.
And plus things are just so real at home
People think Ive changed just because my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere so im never actually am alone, i just always feel alone.
I think im scared of what the future holds.
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.
Every girl I meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes.
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
All my old friends think i got a new crowd.
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.
I guess that mean they come few and far between.
Even though am living out what you would call adream.
Yeah.
And my uncle aint even messaging me.
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.
I hope this isnt one of those forever things.
Its funny how money can change everything.

:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

( 1 )
As i fall deeper into a manic state
Im a prime canidate for the gene to recieve the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of night quil then i salivate
Start off with the night quil like i think i'll just have a taste
Couple sips of that then i gradually graduate 
Too a harder perscription drug called valium like ya that's great
I go to take just one and i end up like having eight 
Now i need something in my stomach cuz i haven't ate
Maybe i'll grab a plate of nachos and i'll have a steak
And you'd think with all i have at stake
Look at my daughters face....
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad i think 
He's acting weird again he's really begining to scare me
Wont shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos 
And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat 

( Hook )
Sometimes i feel so alone,
I just dont know ,feels like i been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as i go home and close the door,
kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place i do,
But i cant and i wont say i tried but i know thats a lie cuz i dont
and why i just dont know..... 


( 2 )
Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer 
Thats the devil in my ear i been sober a fuckin year
And that fucker still talks to me he is all i can fuckin hear
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers
And maybe if i just drink half i'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man i got half a mind
Too have another half of glass of wine sound acinine
Ya i know
But i never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch im about to fall
I missed the couch and down i go looking like a bouncing ball
Shit must have knocked me out cuz i aint feel the ground at all
Wow what the fuck happend last night where am i
Man fuck am i hungover and god damn i got a head ache 
Shit half a vicodin why cant i ? 
" All systems ready for take off please stand by "

( Hook )
Sometimes i feel so alone,

So i take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh 
A couple weeks go by it aint even like im getting high
now i need it just not to feel sick ya im getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die 
Oh ya theres an excuse you lose proof so you use 
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin you to get through
It's twelve noon aint no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes
now here i am 3 months later full blown relapse
Just get high untill the kids get home from two homes relax
And since im convinced that im in-somniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so i take 3 naps 
Just to be able to function throughout the day lets see 
That's an ambian each nap how many valium 3
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken 4 years just too put out an album b 
See me and you we almost had the same outcome he
Cuz that christmas you know the nomonia thing
It was bolognya was it the methadone ya think 
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos 
your vcr tape cases with you ambian cr great places to hide aint it
So you can lie to hailie im going beddy bye whitney baby good night elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor

Brother, I think that necklace is causing you too much trouble


My necklace had the whole crowd on some next shit
The guest list full of real niggas that's hectic
The charm piece made my niggas move like calm beasts
Palm beats, two jostling niggas with long reach
Keep your eyes open for them strong on thieves
Out here looking for ice to put in they teeth
Chain glowing shining and I'm ready for beef
Like my nigga 2 Chainz, cappuccino from the east
From the Wu-Tang Clan, my necklace and my heat
Bang bang, different robe every day of the week
2 Angels, dinner plate, fat dollar sign
Universal flag on, nigga, I got shine




I keep my neck frozen, .45 loaded, please don't approach this
Rope is so ferocious, diamonds that shine in oceans
Keep you arm distant from my carats, silly rabbits
Make me get my barrel, spazzed out and cause havoc
Iced out Cubans, exotic stones from Africa
This the real thing, big bling, the chain swing
Try to swipe mines, that's a no no, the God's loco
Jewelry truckin' fancy spend stacks upon Delancey
Exhaust pipes coughing horse kicks
ACP's dress up the flesh, now the crime scene's gorgeous
My links is unbreakable, told y'all on the Purple Tape
40 inches hang from my neck, nigga, I'm wealthy




Why you say that?
It's real, kill a nigga for this shit
Aha, yo relax sis


Dinner plates rings, smothered in 2 pounds of dope
Eric B on the cut when it blings
Scrubbin' chain down in Colgate, double edged bangers
On they hips I wait in the jaw break
The snakes and the violators, Dracula style takers
We got a bunch of gold balls, but we ain't the Lakers
Hey bitches, stay lickin' my necklace
And I ain't even put the dumb bitch in the guest list
That's what you get when you throwin' on Cuban's
Drawers that's made from silk, a robe and a Ruger
Crack heads catchin' a sweet vix on a scooter
Catch me for my chain, it belongs on a shooter
Lucky my shit blow like a horn on a tuba
You might as well do me now cause I will do ya




God-Cipher-Love-Divine in math 79
Bright yellow and dense in its gift and shine
Still the same when exposed to air and water
Like when amongst thieves you travellin' across the border
The brink of the metal link when in transition remains solid
The message was lost in transmission
That's often in a free elemental form
Nuggets and grains and rocks and things that's norm
Malleable ductile metal on many levels
Get you shot for a Flintstone, killed for a pebble
Lieutenants and Generals move with criminals
The pride for all in line, they hunt for mineral
The scope is on the rope, claws on the table
Brass knuckle, knees buckle, legs unstable
And it's sold by the weight
Shaped into a plate with food on it
The hungry wolves lie and wait




Tu Tin-To. So you're the tigers of Tinan, bastard, you're gonna pay for this, you'll die here. I'll use the tiger strike to kill you all. I'll show you the three different strokes. Forest Tiger! Win Tiger, Winmau Tiger!

What money got to do with it 
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image? 
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it 
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit 
Hol' up 
Get it back 
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it 
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what? 

If I was the president 
I'd pay my mama's rent 
Free my homies and them 
Bulletproof my Chevy doors 
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord 
Who ever thought? 
Master take the chains off me 

Life can be like a box of chocolate 
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious 
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it 
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive 
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics 
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant 
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious 
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges 
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is 
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it 
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this 
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal 
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god 
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged 
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards 
You lookin' at artists like the harvests 
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them 
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry 
I should've listened what my grandmama said to me 

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga 
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass 
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga 
Oh now, slow down 

And once upon a time in a city so divine 
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid 
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said 

What I'm s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks? 
The convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips 
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor 
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for 
Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this? 
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist 
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it 
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds? 
No more livin' poor, meet my .44 
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor 
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers 
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey 
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay 
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA 
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor? 
Well that's me at these awards 
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy 
She said... 

And once upon a time in a city so divine 
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused 
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse 
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie 
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey 
Hollywood's nervous 
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service

Why do I feel so alone? 
Like everybody passing through the studio ,
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role ,
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know,
And I don't have the heart to give these, 
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go, 
So they stick around kicking out feedback, 
And I entertain it as if I need that, 
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that,
My privacy about the only thing I need back but, 
It's hard to think of them polite flows, 
Mr. Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes, 
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes, 
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed, 
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows, 
Life was so full, 
Now this shit just being lipo'd, 
Always said I'd say it all on the right track, 
But in this game you only lose when you fight back, 
Black diamond bracelets, 
Showing you the basics, 
I can't live and hold the camera, 
Someone gotta tape this, 
I make hits unlike a bitch, 
That's married I ain't miss, 
24 hours from greatness, 
I'm that close, 
Don't ever forget the moment, 
You began to doubt, 
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out, 
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South, 
Watchin' whole show, 
Embarrassed to pull my camera out, 
And my mother embarrassed, 
To pull my Phantom out, 
So I park about 5 houses down, 
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown, 
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around, 
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus, 
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness, 
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus, 
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless, 
And promoters try to get me out to they club, 
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how, 
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, 
Standing with my next girl, 
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now, 
And shit could get weird unless they all down, 
And so I stay clear.

We from a small town, 
Everybody talks and everybody listen, 
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing, 
I've always been something that these labels can't buy, 
Especially if they tryin' to take a peice of my sou,l 
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez "Damn Drake fly" 
And he just be like "Silly mother fucker I know" 
That was your bad, 
How could you pass up on 'em? 
He just take them records, 
And he gas up on 'em, 
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em, 
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em, 
Oh they did Po, 
At least they tried to, 
And that's what happens, 
When you spitting what's inside you, 
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video, 
And they think they can market you, 
However they decide to nahh, 
But Forty told me to do me, 
And don't listen to anybody that knew me, 
'Cause to have known me would, 
Mean that there's a new me, 
And if you think I changed in the slightest, 
Could of fooled me, 
Boy in my city I'm da 2-3, 
Drug dealers live vicariously through me, 
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy, 
I'm just not the social type, 

And campus life is crazy understand, 
I could get money with my eyes closed, 
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo, 
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll, 
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know, 
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will, 
I got new shit, 

I'm gettin' better still, 
Little niggas put my name in they verses, 
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal, 
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill, 
And I think this got this "Making of a Legend" feel, 
Problem with these other niggas they, 
Ain't never real, 
Yea ... that's all I can say.

I’m more than just an option
Hey, Hey, Hey

Don't be so...

Baby, don't worry about it
Hey there, don't even think about it

You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things

VERSE #1:

Tell me right now, you really wanna spend your whole life alone
A little time out might do ya good, might do us good before we be done for good
Because I could make it good, I could make it hood, I could make you come, I could make you gooo
I could make you hot, I could make you fly, make you touch the sky, Hey, maybe sooo
All of the time, he be up in my, checking through my cell phone, baby no
You wanna kill the vibe, on another night, here's another fight, Oh, here we go (Oh, here we go)

HOOK:

Baby, don't worry 'bout it
Lady, we'll go out to the floor

Anyway, they don't know you like I do (They don't know)
They'll never know you (Never know)
Anyway, they don't know you like I do (Never know)
They'll never know you

VERSE #2

All of the time, you wanna complain about the nights alone
So now, you here with me, stressin about a 2 liter, leave the attitude way back at home
Yeah, you see 'em look, baby, let 'em look, give you cold looks cuz we look cold
Yeah, you heard about all the word of mouth, don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world, loss in the world 'till you finally let that thing gooo
You wanna check-in to the heartbreak hotel but sorry we're closed


HOOK:

Baby, don't worry 'bout it
Baby, we'll go out to the floor

Anyway, (Hey!) they don't know you like I do (To the floor)

Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home


They want me locked down, fryin' in jail
Before you hear that I decided to tell, I'd rather die in a cell
I was framed like a wedding flick, 2 time felon
Still a predicate, doin' time, tell 'em that's a negative
Prejudice judge, bails be a mil' in cash
Scorin' money like the meter on the Yellow Cab
Give the witness an unexpected visit
Make his story change like walls blockin' his vision
Couldn't give a clear description, fearin' the repercussions
Like, "I was on the ground, I ain't see him bustin'"
Now the DA chasin' a plea, they hatin' I'm free
The case is mistaken identity


Whoever push me like Pusha T, I push back
I push a cap, before '93, I pushed crack
I'm hood, black, you know me well, what's good Scrap?
I'm smokin' rappers, you are a L, what's good Smack?
Hold up that's goods rap, pardon self
I just like good rap, but when I see goods I give his goods back
I rap for riders that pack strap to rhymers that backpack
To 25 to lifers that jack MAC
We movin' ratchets, no Kat Stacks, it's magic
The way we flip the package before the coppers can catch it
I'm past that chapter in life, let's live it lavish
When life take a piss in your bed, you flip the mattress
Before you try and get my head, get you some Pampers
Then take a long look at my ish and get your answers
Kick in my vicinity, I'm what rappers pretend to be
Charge 'em with a penalty, mistaken identity

 (x2)
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy


Fresh off of work, he jumped out the van
Two suitcases, dangle on his hands
He opened up the door, headed up the stairs
Thought he heard a noise, but no one else was there
First sight he saw, struck him by surprise
Two shots was given, between his girl's eyes
Windows blown out, no prints on the door
All he seen was blood stains, smear the damn floor
911, ambulance showed up
Blood everywhere, paramedics throwin' up
Cops cuffed him up, hit him with the charge
But he was bangin' Mrs. Prixy at the Motor Lodge
He got his alibis, gonna use 'em all
The screw fit the judge, he might take the fall
Someone set him up, a botched robbery
Mistaken identity, yeah it gotta be


17 years old, I'm headed back to the hole
Mistaken identity, every way was sold
I look like a hoodlum, I rock a lot of gold
They lockin' everybody up, ship your ass up the road
I ain't have a 9 on me, they was lyin' on me
Court day with my old bird, they was spyin' on me
Tried to set me up, plantin' coke in my pocket
The beast pat me up, they won't let me off


Na-n-n-n-n-n-n-nah it wasn't me
It could never been the G-O-D, not me
You terribly mistaken, son, I ain't the one
We could never look nothin' like, whether near or far sight
What resemblance does he strike? So my mic Fahrenheit
W for my a-alike, your DNA match tight
Even if they bite us, close but not quite
They still tryna get it right, mistaken identity

Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights


She don't believe in shootin' stars, 
But she believe in shoes & cars
Wood floors in the new apartment, 
Couture from the store's department
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit, 
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Order the hors devors, views of the Water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy, 
Man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy, 
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these nigga's got me, 
I hate these nigga's more than the Nazis


As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights


I know it's been a while, 
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay, 
A-bay late-ly you been all on my brain, 
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no fema
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum, 
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa, 
Come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar


As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights

Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights


Lights, lights, lights, lights...

(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.)
Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Drawin' a Blank like
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.

Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma do that for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()

Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
Imeet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

 x2
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man


Yo, pa, I got a lady, I'm 'bout to make her my baby
Might even make a baby, the thesis makin' her crazy
She know my style wavy, I'm circlin' her Mercedes
Father, father was a preacher, I'm almost certain he hates me
But he ain't gotta date me and look, his baby is grown
And she decides on her own who resides on the throne
I'm her king, she my queen, we keep it right in the zone
And she understands the fact that I'm even right when I'm wrong
When she was prayin' in church, I was playin' in dirt
That's 100, I admit that we both was playin' at first
When opposites attract, I ain't always sayin' it works
I'm just sayin' ain't no use in me strayin', that make it worse
It's Wu-Tang, baby, my crew bang
And she's the preacher's daughter, I just call her my boo thang
And we tighter than shoestrings, or 10 grand in rubber bands
Man, sometimes I tell your parents just don't understand


No. yo, you mean Pastor Brown's daughter?
The preacher, the rich slave-maker of the poorer?
I used to see her Sundays comin' from church
We used to kick it at her window when her pops at work
Yo, her parents didn't play
She couldn't even come out to play on a school day
Thought she was gonna give me some on April Fool's day
(But no, no way) nah, (no, no-no, no-no, no-no way)


The preacher's daughter, she an illegitimate child
She know the word, but she be runnin' in them streets foul
She married to a man, but she's crushin' his brother now
See her in the market place loud and boisterous
With tight spandex on, chokin' her oysters
She a seductress in the form of a goddess
Never virtuous or modest, poison the part is
Breakin' the vessel, turn brother against brother
Man, that's how she molest you
That's why the preacher man prolly a mess too
Cause the fruit that she devourin' is evil
Never sin around righteous people
Black widow, preacher's daughter comin' to eat you

 x4


I met her on the bus stop with black eyes
That's why she said she don't fuck with black guys
I cleaned her up, fed her all my wisdom
Her father spit the gospel but she never caught the vision
Brutal ass whoopins, always facin' these evictions
So she only fuck with thugs that'll wind up in the system
Them greasy bastards quick to squeeze a ratchet
Never knew the science of virtue, Ecclesiastes
Like, a time for peace, a time for war
A time to laugh though, she never felt God before
Eternal love that'll pop like a kernel, this is grown folk talk
Between me and her, it don't concern you

 x4

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated
against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,
give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the
evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but
they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...



I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm
cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I
never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me
inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a
multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father
must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,
no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I
couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it
work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm
man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest
shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot
Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...



Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you
think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'
your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'
through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of
Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew
up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made
that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your
gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna
know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but
you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't
admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare
you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in
hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess
what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...

Better watch out sucker now I got ya where I want ya,
onslaught, coming and Im packing in my lunch up,
bunch a missile launcher and a bunch a contra,
van van full of ganja, now come on jump,
man stop marchin marshall on my gotcha,
doin’ the cha cha and the kucharcha with a quadri-plegic,
boogieing down to Frank Sinatra,
Lyndsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya,
who da knew the puda do ta me whats its done,
such cynicism when this isn’t in my system,
blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lip son,
so much on my hands, i got to give my kids a fist pump,
Chris-to-pher Reeves swimming in my swim trunks,
Mister, “help me” whats he said to me and then sunk,
women skinning them and cutting them up in chunks,
in comes the woman with cocoa butter skin ones,


Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-buffalo bill,
skin em up, hym em,
sew em up in those kilts, up in those kilts,
upa upa up in those kilts,
man you don’t want to go up in those hills,
up in those hills, uppa up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill,
buffa-buffalo bill,


Always, you can see em lurking in the hallways,
carcasues of caucasion females in his draw space,
how the hell did he fit em all in such a small space,
hide em in the wall but how long will the dry wall take,
well f-ck it then, I got nothing but time, I’ll wait,
until its dries for the moment i guess your all safe,
after I sand it and buff it I guess that I’ll paint,
my chainsaw’s outta gas my regular saw aint,
now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling,
you can even hear the evil spirits coming from within,
someones in, the back of my damn house rummaging,
its a girl, she looks pretty thin but I want to skin,
been on the hunt again, when will it ever end,
Evelyn why you trying to fight you will never win,
http://www.elyricsworld.com/buffalo_bill_lyrics_eminem.html
severing legs, arms, damn there goes another limb,
pull the lever then trap door, death is evident




Now what you know about Buffalo Bill,
nothing so chill,
f-cking hoe, you better f-cking hold still,
make sure none of that lotion in that bucket don’t spill,
cut em gut em and just keep stuffing those girls,
man I think she had enough of those pills,

sedate her, then I wait her come back later just to clutch on those steel blades
braids, baby when I cut ya dont squeal
I hate the loud noises I f-cking told you,
I keep hearing voices like
wouldn’t you like to go and get ya put ya knife
and push it right through it while ya put ya shishkebab skewer
into a barbecue or would ya do to her what you usually do to a girl who’s skins newer,


In a World of Sin doer this is turning into a torment tournament of sorts,
Christmas Ornament you are,


I”ll be sure to Gensu ya til there’s no more skin to ya,
boo ya who ya think you f-cking with,
duck because here he comes again,



Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
Some shit about a message you left 
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" 
This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! 
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre 
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way) 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch 

So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
We can fly over the border "Let's go" 
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
 (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri 
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste 
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Plus he raps with his regular voice 
 (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys 
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ 
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! 
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
Do somethin'! At least one punchline 
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs 
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither 
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!) 
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch




(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
> Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will serve you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?


(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right


(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right
Aw Yeah

Like we always do it this time

(I go for mine I got to shine)

(I go go for mine I got to shine)

Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay Im Good]
Welcome to the good life where the ***** stay on d

The good life, lets go on a living spree 
They say the best things in life are free

Ayyyyyyy this is the good life welcome to good life

50 told me go head switch your style up
And if they hate let em hate an watch the money pile up

Have you ever pop champagne on a plane 
While gettin some in with that i never seen snakes on a plane
Whether your broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin money nots everything but havin it is
I was sprlurgin on tred
But when i get my card back activated im back to Vegas
Cause i always had a passion for flashin and before i had it

Is the good life better than the life i live
When i thought i was gonna go crazy
Now my grand-mama aint the only girl callin me baby
If you feeling me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyy Im Good

Oh shit! 
Oh, I need that 
I need that sloppy 
That sloppy 
Like a Chevy in quicksand 
That sloppy 

This feelin' is unmatched 
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap 
Black (Pendleton) ball cap 
(West, west, west) 
We don't share the same synonym fall back 
(West, west, west) 
Been in it before internet had new acts 
Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack 
My innocence limited the experience lacked 
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked 
The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact 
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic 
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards 
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction 
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest 
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic 
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion 
Winnin' in every decision 
Kendrick is master and mastered it 
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction? 
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic 
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque 
But what's better than that? 
The fact it brought me back home 

We been waitin' for you 
Waitin' for you 
Waitin' for you 
Waitin' for you 

I know everything, I know myself 
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health 
I know fatality might haunt you 
I know everything, I know Compton 
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything 
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors 
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma 
I know everything, I know history 
I know the universe works mentally 
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me 
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money 
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's Ornery 
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies 
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition 
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision 
I know you know that lines from Compton School District 
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip about how it was distributed 
I know how people work, I know the price of life 
I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well 
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit 
The day I came home 


Nappy afro, gap in his smile 
Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd 
Runnin' home and the man and woman that crossed him 
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted 
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles 
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin' 
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language 
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted 
Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous 
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was takin' 
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it 
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor 
Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress 
And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil 
You spoiled by fantasies of who you are 
I feel bad for you 
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you 
If you resist, I'll back off go catch a flight or two 
But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace 
Than be an advocate go tell your homies especially 
To come back home 

This is a world premiere 
This is a world premiere 
This is a world premiere 

I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite 
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside? 
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind? 
Tell me something got me losing my mind, AH! 
You make me wanna jump 
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump 
(Let's talk about love)) 
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump 
(Let's talk about love)) 
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite 
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside? 
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind? 
Tell me something think I'm losing my mind, AH! 
I say where you at, from the front to the back 
I'm lookin' for you I react, only when you react 
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto 
When I was seventeen with the .38 special 
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real 
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel 
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway 
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway 
I can be your advocate 
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is

Everything black, I don't want black 
I want everything black, I ain't need black 
Some white some black, I ain't mean black 
I want everything black 

Six in the mornin', fire in the street 
Burn, baby burn, that's all I wanna see 
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain 
It's such a shame they may call me crazy 
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin' 
But homie you made me 
Black don't crack my nigga 

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses 
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it 
I'm African-American, I'm African 
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village 
Pardon my residence 
Came from the bottom of mankind 
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide 
You hate me don't you? 
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture 
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey 
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me 
And this is more than confession 
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion 
I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it 
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin' 
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot 

I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black 
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black 
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black 
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks 
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back 
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block 
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black 
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that 

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society 
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me 
Curse me till I'm dead 
Church me with your fake prophesyzing that I'mma be just another slave in my head 
Institutionalize manipulation and lies 
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes 
You hate me don't you? 
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself 
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt 
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out 
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah 
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special 
CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you? 
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'? 
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree 
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred 
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification 
I'm African-American, I'm African 
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan 
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius 
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all 
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you? 
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you 
I can tell cause your ways deceitful 
Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle 
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him 
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war 
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy 
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door 
Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score 
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers 
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers" 
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day 
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays 
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements 
Or watch BET cause urban support is important 
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street? 
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me? 
Hypocrite!



Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh-t
When I hear talkin, I just dont know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams who Im racing with
You can see Im pacin it so that Im always chasin it
Wayne put me right here, thats who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own, but its lookin like July 4th
But I just wish theyd let you try it first
This time Im really goin off, fireworks



When I go off like July 4th
feels like a fire, Got to go higher
Its your revelation, my sweet celebration
light me like a rocket, cause can't nothing stop it
all I see is fireworks,
all i see is fireworks
every night its fireworks
every night its fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off like fireworks


I got this one girl, you know, in my life
so I say in this song, I say
I'm just such a gentleman
you should give it up for me
look at how I'm placing al my napkins and my cutlery
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you f-ck with me
who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me
yeh, I kept my wits about me luckilly
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
and you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
but I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
what an experience
you coulda been the one but it wasnt that serious
their was smoke in the air before now its me cleaing it
that felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
now I can see it in her eyes
Fireworks!

 


Everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that I still listen
and he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my Realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city I let her explore
ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close
yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first, that's why I'm really going off, Fireworks!



When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
If I die all I know is I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way
Money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'on't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'mma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D, I'm the holy one
Yeaaah, you know wassup
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

Just the two of us.. 


Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Just the two of us.. 


Just me and you baby

Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby




I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy


Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal


Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, "Baby girl, fall in line, " ok
Made a million, off of denim
Fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "I'll nigga alert! I'll nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)




I touched down in '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with' us and we don't fuck with' y'all, it's no different over on this side
God damn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, "You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help"
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,
Ya'll keep talking 'bout who next,
But I'm about how big as it gets,
I swear ya'll just wastin' ya'll breath,
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,
I'm a make it last forever,
It's not your time 'cause I ain't done yet,
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,
I was made for all of this shit,
And I'm on the road box office sales,
I'm getting paid for all of this shit,
Ask you to please excuse my table manners,
I was making room for the table dancers,
'Cause if we judging off your advances,
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!




HOE, SHUT THE fuck UP
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rest do
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythang
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit
Good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth
Drink a fifth
Load the nine
Leave you split, in the half
Smoke a half, Need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me
And I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'
Lil' bitch


Oh Me. Oh Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that, that ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)
I'm blessed than a motherfucker,
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin' nervous, clutchin' they chests like a motherfucker,
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail,
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man,
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do. 


Worst...


Mothafucka never loved us, fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now, still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions, nigga we don't know shit
Flexing! Nigga, I'm just flexing
Nigga never loved us, do it look like we stressing?
Look at you, look at you and look at you, aww, I'm glad that they chose us
Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish, just to see if I'm finished


On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us... Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up?
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior


Hold up, hold my phone, mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us, now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us, so everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up! You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B




Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothing changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm coming back on my worst behavior


Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior


Yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

Yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
All my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
In this New World the Order slaughter men, women, and children
Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
The projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
Constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
It's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll
Trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model, I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
Their life and times, deadly like the virus design
But too, minute to dilute, the scientist mind

You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads
To skin irritations, babies being born with
Disfigurations, experimentations
On their faces there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain screams of terror
Are hidden by the passing trains
This can't be little Hussein, his uncle cried
As he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
Just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
Bitter sickness, and left us to witness


Yeah, yo
Curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
Tree of life, more precious than Wu is golden game
The wise self flourish inherit, Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
While we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
Blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
It's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
Zero process, progress, become the hunted
America's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
Some love the speed, some satisfy a need
Some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
The strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
One flew astray, and it caught my little seed
Can it be, the ice have us trife life, made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
Take in my energy, breath and know the rest
Cause the good die young and the hard die best

You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


Y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
While your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in stench
You either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays
Inside my lab, I'm going mad
Took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods
The whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn
Early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe


As we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
Mama say, take your time young man and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searching for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings
The cash rule everything now, we going down
These babies looking up to us, it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's, get on the bus
But envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer, brothers, we unstable
Like Kane when he slew Abel, killing each other

You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way

Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night


Okay, back when I was sleepin’ in my mama’s crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin’ seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you
Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you
I'm saying...


Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
She got me
And we are we are we are
She got me


Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies' gon' disown a nigga
Like, give me 20 dolla, dolla
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', "Please play!"
For pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever
But...




Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to pick it
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch


Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long


We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) shake your body


Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khaki's pressed, Nike shoes just crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made Em just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in dang, bang bang
Yes sir Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang dang
P-p-p-pow chicka pow chicka wow wow
Got your gal blowin' up a val-v-v-v-val-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now hoe




We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) get your vials




And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard, drugs are though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you a loan, car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers, shit head with a potty mouth
Get the bar soap lathered, Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl you’re fixin' to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd man
You birdbrain baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you’re a swallow
Word, Rick word man you heard, but don’t be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam





Didn't you know, I was waitin on you
Waitin' on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know, I was waitin' on you
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When'd you decide to break the rules?
Cause I just heard some real bad news

People talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you, how long have you known dude?
You played it off and act like he's brand new
When'd you decide to break the rules?
Cause I just heard some real bad news

Real bad news 

Oh you just goin' keep another, no you wont
Oh you just goin' keep it like you never knew
Oh you just goin' keep another love for you
Oh you just goin' keep em like you never knew
While im waitin on a dream that'll never come true
Oh you just goin' keep em like you never knew
My face turned to stone when I heard the news

Whats on the news?

No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work a night shift

Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift

Young, but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Louuuu)

Stadium status...
Unh...
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Use to be Dame and Bigg's brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, now let the story begin
It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout; picture
us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out "Jigga!"
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, "He could change yo' life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the Chig'"
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib


Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Use to be Dame and Bigg's brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, now let the story begin
Begin... let the story begin... story begin
If you feel the way I feel
Why don't you wave your hands, hands...


Fresh off the plane, Im off to Baseline
Nothin' handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'Round the same time of that "Blueprint" one
And these beats in my pocket was that "Blueprint" forum
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'll bob his head and say "Damn! Oh, that's you?"
But by the "Black Album" I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like "Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Colleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum


My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Use to be Dame and Bigg's brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, now let the story begin
Begin... let the story begin, begin...
If you feel the way I feel
Why won't you wave your hands


Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito
Hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped "Jesus Walks" now I'm on the steephole
And we know, "New Jack City" got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that "Diamonds" remix I swore I was fast
Then my big brother came thru and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammy's I said "I inspired me"
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pick-and-roll
Cuz even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gon' mingle, yo
Heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like "Damn, no way"
Translate, espanol "No way, Jose"
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known THAT was gon' come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the city, Roc-A-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother


My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Use to be Dame and Bigg's brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

Toomp killed this shit...

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated
against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,
give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the
evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but
they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...



I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm
cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I
never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me
inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a
multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father
must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,
no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I
couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it
work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm
man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest
shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot
Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...



Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you
think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'
your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'
through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of
Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew
up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made
that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your
gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna
know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but
you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't
admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare
you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in
hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess
what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...

I'm cold (Yeah), I'm cold (Yeah), I'm cold (Yeah) (Yeah)


I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might
See you in my nightmare, oh well how did you get there
Cause we were once a fairytale
But this is fair well


I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So goodnight, I made it out the door X 4
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road

And that you know
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know...

Okay I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gone do mine
You do you, cause I'm just gone be fine
Okay I got you out my mind
And The night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well now you know...
Tell everybody everybody that you know!
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know


I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might
See you in my nightmare, oh but how did you get there
Cause we were once a fairytale
But this is fair well

Baby girl I'm finished
I thought we were committed
I thought we were cemented
I really thought we meant it
But Now we just repenting
And Now we just resenting
The clouds is in my vision
Look how high that I be getting
And it's all because of you
Girl we through
You think your shit don't stink but you are Mrs. P-U
And I don't see you with me no more
Now tell everybody that you know
That you know!


That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know
That you know
Tell everyone that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know...

Loving you is complicated 

I place blame when you steal 
Place shame when you steal 
Feel like you ain't shit 
Feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself 
Breakin' on marble floors 
Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours 
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special 
What can I blame him for 
Nigga I can name several 
Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin' 
A baby inside, just a teenager where's your antennas 
Whats your intentions where is the influence you speak of 
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her 
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure you ain't no leader 
I never liked you, forever despise you I don't need you 
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you 
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, thats for dedication 
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent 
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it 

Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof 
I can feel you vibin', recognize that your ashamed of me 
Yes I hate you too 

House keeping 
 
House keeping 
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto! 
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto¡ 
!Disculpe! 

Are you the reason why mama and them leavin' 
No you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it 
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it 
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it 
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out 
You was deserted, where was your antennas again? 
Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend? 
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend 
A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend 
Little brother, you promised you’d watch him before they shot him 
Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches 
You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven 
You even faced time instead of a hospital visit 
You should thought he would recover, well 
The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real 
Then he died, God himself will say "you fuckin' failed" 
You ain't try 

I know your secrets nigga 
Mood swings is frequent nigga 
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga 
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin' nigga 
Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and your the reason nigga 
And if this bottle could talk *gulp* I cry myself to sleep 
Bitch everything is your fault 
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend 
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed 
I know your secrets 
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin' 
And that time you *gulp* I'm bout to hurl 
I'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you 
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof 
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago 
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago 
And if those mirrors could talk it would say "you gotta go" 
And if I told your secrets 
The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness



I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly,
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home (home)

I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly,
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high, love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it (oh yeah)
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

So just hold on we're going home (going home)
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on we're going home (going home, going home)

You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

You're the girl

Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me

Oh just hold on we're going home (going home)
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on we're going home (going home, going home)
Hold on 

You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Yeahhh, torture motherfucker what?
(Torture nigga what?)
What?
I'll fuckin
I'll fuckin tie you to a fuckin bedpost

I hate rich niggas goddammit
Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit
Who you had to kill, who you had to rob
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top dammit.
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator no ladder money
Escalating new caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money.
Crookest smile nigga momma never had the money damn
I ain't trippin' a nigga Jordan I ain't Pippen yeah
Up the steps I ain't slippin'
Tears blood sweat I ain't crippin, Pierce
A song you can sing along with when you down
So I let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas you think she out there getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga plus dawg I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crash and only it killed his lame ass
I'd be glad its that nigga
Did Kate dirty now it's back to broke
Refund check she used that to float.
Momma gets depressed falls in love with the next maniac
On crack use that to cope.
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crash the boat could of drowned
But I grabbed the rope

There go you (x3)
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew(x3)


You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul and uh
How much for your soul and uh


I hate rich niggas goddammit
Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now hear my shit and tried to switch now.
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't it more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power
Fuck it more to you, so I threw you
And it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for more money like Damon Wayons
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but it just ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watching little Jermaine do his thang before he made a name
It's like ? Basquiat
He gave it all he got now the nigga don't paint the same.
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Thinking old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame
My brain the same, yeah nigga at least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy motherfucker you just afraid of change.
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you.
And I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more.
Tad bit extreme I know.
Money can't save your soul.
But there go you

There go you
There go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And nigga who you (x3)
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew



How much for your soul and uh

And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter
It don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter)
You'll see in the end

I've got a feeling that there's somethin' more
Something that holds us together
Something that holds us together
The strangest feeling but I can't be sure
Something that's old is forever
Something that's old is forever
Love
Love
Love
Love

And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter
It don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter)
You'll see in the end

"Morning, Marshall."
"Morning, doc."
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
"Anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. 
Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"
"Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back"
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."
"Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and 
it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, 
we know you're a busy person."
"But I thought variety was the most important thing?"
"So what else are you thinking?"
"Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, 
and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."
"Steps?"
"Yeah, steps."
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?
"Well, twelve."
"Christ, I don't even know them all."
"Really?"
"Anything else?"
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, 
what do I do if I find myself in a situation where 
maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I 
get tempted to?"
"Take a drink."
"What?"
"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."
"Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink 
I already know what that's gonna lead me to."
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
"Man, what the fuck!?"
"Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? 
Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. 
We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall...? Marshall!?
"No, no, no, no, NO!"

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic
I like to ask it, don't ask for
Your favorite rapper

(He dead) yessir
(Amen) chuuch
(He dead) I killed him
(Amen) bitch

And this is rigamortis
And it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus
The Matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit
You an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme
If you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin
And then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph
Into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures
My listeners reply and tell me
That you biting style
You got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while
Just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight
We always making them duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI, just might investigate
This fucking parasite

(He dead)
(Amen)

That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity
This is studio felony
There would not be so many
And cool enough for the 70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch
And bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant
Rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody
Couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q
It's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
So the system ain't why we ___
Ain't nothing else you can do

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I killed him
(He dead) hahaha
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask who your favorite rapper

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask who your favorite rapper

I rapped him and made him Casper
I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya
I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, once you sinister
Bible study faster
You hypocrite is reaction of blasphemy
I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done
And tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds
Don't talk to be bout no money
The sun is under my feet
And I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap
My statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek
And I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody done see
Some persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the streets
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick, in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
And y'all fucks, never could hassle me
And y'all luck, just ran out you'll see

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen




We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!


Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here


Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth
Cuz the people that hurt can’t understand it
You speakin outlandish, I’m ashamed how to make it all work
Another planet, it’s a short term role for me
I rec it’s all for me, it’s just mo with me
And you’re here for you too here can re-persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin off, I ain’t takin off these pistons
I’m takin off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much it’d cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a shortterm goal, no sky is the limit
I’m past that, now pass that
A word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours


I see myself performing at
Soldout shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammys, winning 5 awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Can’t imagine how it feels
That’s why I’m smiling every day
Cause my dream ain’t far away


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


You’re looking at me and tell me I’m blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I’m at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, I’m reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I’m a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow I’mma take that I’ll never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I root
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin to you, I was walkin it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello


And I’m so happy I cry
Cause I can’t believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it’s so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you play so hard
And you’ve come so far
And you go, that is the time for you to leave your more
And I’m gonna do it
Watch me


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better 


Hi! My name is.. (what?) My name is.. (who?)
My name is..  Slim Shady
Hi! My name is.. (huh?) My name is.. (what?)
My name is..  Slim Shady

Ahem.. excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?


Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Ummmm..)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh! "So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!




My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Owwwwwwww!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians
In a space ship while they screaming at me: "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans (Aaahhhhhh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!'




Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive (Huh yup!)
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? (WAH!)
YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS! (WAHHH!)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (BANG!)
I'm steaming mad (Arrrggghhh!)
And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had




Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial


Head to the sky, wings raised in
Shes about to fly and take her place in
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground
She’ll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But aint no going back, this is how it must be
He told her, she’ll be burned alive
She just told him trust me
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing she told her you’ll leave me if you loved me
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feeling’s as it engulfs her
Now she’s a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape
So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like, the end, question mark (question mark, question mark)


Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial


Don’t let me hold you back
I only hold you back
We on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby, so high, sometimes its so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to ballet
We pulled up to the valet, we’ll teach our daughter ballet
We’ll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she’ll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom
I would have been the best ‘Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know thats very gross but we getting very close
To our end, though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I’ma let Mos begin


Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you doDon’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

How could you do it
How could you do it


Okay now baby here we go, we go
No baby, me go
You got my heart
Baby this what it be for
I give it all as far as my feet go
What do you mean, me go
Why can’t it be, we go
What happens when people turn to tears
Dreams turn to memories
And weeks turn to years
Huh? standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish it came with a couple reciepts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl I swear you was a trip, lets make it a couples retreat (do it)
How cud my girl do this to me
Woke up sayin no, the World did this to me
Now I’m testing one two
Reportin live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle
But its not even half the feeling as hearing you shine
She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday
And I’m tired of lying in these puddles
I ask “Y” sometimes like a f-cking vowel
But hitting tree’s everyday like a f-cking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out.
So I could see you smile
I-I know you can see me now



Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

Im not lovin you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
Im in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, til its over love
Til we lose control, system overload
Screamin no no no, no no

See I wanna move, but cant escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else dont have to know


So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
You keep ya love locked down, you lose


Im not lovin you, the way I wanted to
I cant keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin to lose, so I gotta move
I cant keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when Im on my own
Somewhere far from home, In the danger zone
How many times did it take til I finally got through
you lose, you lose
I aint lovin you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to go
No more wastein time, we cant wait for life
which is wastin time, wheres the finish line


So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
You keep ya love locked down, you lose


Im not lovin you, the way i wanted to
I met no one new, I got no one new
No I said im through, but got love for you
But im not lovin you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin, keep the lovin goin
Keep it on a roll, only god knows
Am I into you, baby im confused
You choose, you choose

If you keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, you lose

Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there
There is no right or wrong
Only a song
I like to write alone
Be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasin' panties, gettin' dome
Had no clue what you was goin' through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl
Damn she so selfless, but she put up with my way
Because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together
(I love you mama)

Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it

Another day another rhyme ho
Another day another time zone
Today I woke up feelin' horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playin' on my trumbone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me
Nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot dog, catch up to me nigga
Uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was ridin' on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sittin' on the hood of this bitch
Like thanks for the view
Waitin' on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit gave you the blueprint don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showin' off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowin' soft
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing
Gettin' head like a coin toss
Too easy

Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it


Cause some things just don’t change
It’s better when they stay the same
Althought the whole world knows your name
So on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game
Ooooohhhhhhh
It shouldn’t be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice you remain
fuck em’ all, tell ‘em all eat shit, here we go again

So, god damn… is it that time again already
Haha, you don’t look too happy to see me
fuck man, don’t everybody welcome me back at once
All right, fuck ya’ll then


You can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, I’m nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, Dog fall back you mutts
fuck your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy
fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck sick mummy
And my nuts licked, gobble ‘em up trick, yummy
 b**ch you don’t fucking think that I know that you suck dick dummy?
You’ll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it’s funny!
Shawty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don’t listen to ‘em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker
Motherfucker might aswell let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, cause I’m just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on, cause you wen’t and pissed me off
Now I’m sitting and pissing on everbody
give a fuck if it’s right or wrong
So buck the buddah, light a bong
But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, cmon


Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh


fuck it I’m a loose cannon, Bruce Banner’s back in the booth
Ya’ll are sitting ducks, I’m the only goose standing
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my d*ck in a circle, but I’m not fucking around motherfucker
I’ll show you pussy footin, I’ll kick a bitch in the cunt
Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin’, you musta mistook me for some sissy
Soft punk looking for some nookie or boosom
Go ahead, fucking hater push me
I told you ain’t no fucking way to shush me
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G’s up
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!)
Man chill, nah I can’t god damnit
Rap is a land fill, drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can’t fill
shit the day that happens the world’ll stop spinning
And Michael J. Fox’ll come to a stand still
During an earthquake, urine in your face
Cause you’re fake, ahh what the fuck, that hurt wait!
Ahh what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening
Alright then I quit, god I give up
Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To hell I’ll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh


How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day
til I hang up the mic and it’s time for me to say
So long, til then i drop the fucking bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long
If you don’t like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh b**ches don’t like that, homie I’ll be nicer to women
When aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming
lyrics courtesy of killer hip hop dot com
Man I’m a cold soul, I roll solo so
So don’t compare me to them other bums over there
It’s like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
I’m bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I’ll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

(Outro)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I don’t know, I don’t know what caused, I don’t know what caused me to be this wayme to be this way
I don’t know, I don’t know by I probably be this way til my dying day
I don’t know why I’m so, I’m so cold beat bangs, I don’t need to say
I guess this is how you made me



Uh
I’m just so far gone
October’s own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screaming in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on
Where did we go wrong
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game
And its one I can’t post pone
Meaning if it rains
I’m the one its raining on
With my diamond chain’s on
Still nothing setting stone
Women borrow sweaters
That I spray with my cologne
And tell me don’t forget them
And I promise that I won’t
Feeling so distant from everyone I’ve known
To make everybody happy
I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown
Parties that we’ve thrown
I done more for this city
Than these rappers that have blown
Its only been 3 years
Look at how I’ve grown
I’m just in my zone
I call this shit the calm

Yeah

But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom
And I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay
And it wont even take that long
You can see it in my face
Even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school
Its proven and its known
I’m sittin’ in a chair
But in the future, it’s a throne
I know you like to worry
It’d be better if you don’t
Cuz….


You know…
Everything gone be all right
I promise
I apologize to you know
Put y’all in this position
40 Mama always say
Don’t ask permission, just ask forgiveness you know
So uhh
Forgive me
Yeah


Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a vantage you can gain
They love it when you smile
Unaware that it’s a strain
It’s a curse you gotta live with
When you’re born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say you’re the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Terrence in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It’s a weight that’s on my chest
Who ever spottin’ me is playin’
So I’m liftin’ all alone
Trynin’ not to get a sprain
Hopin’ Western Junior doin’ currency exchange

Cuz my dad called
It got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like
I had a rolls and I went and got a range
And he payin’ for his cigarettes
With some dollars and some change
Yeah
And I can only feel his pain
Cuz in Memphis, Tennessee
There is only so much to attain
So I’m fillin’ out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me
I just hope he doesn’t say that shit in vain
I’m why your girls heart is in a slain
Call me Heartbreak Drake
I’m the hardest one to tame
As a man, I’m just honest
As an artist, I’m a king
With my own set of problems
That be sittin’ on my brain
Yeah
And see this is the thang
What they viewin’ as braggin’
Is the way that I maintain
The shit I write
While starin’ out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I remain

Me


Yeah…
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
That’s why I’m putting on
They always wanna ask what type of act that you putting on
Like…. Damn 


Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn’t be driving, it just got so much harder
Can’t even see straight, I can’t even see straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I’m the truth that’s right I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain’t gotta die to get to heaven
You Girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How’d I know, how’d I know? That’s me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you asking me my where-abouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rappin’ bitches, rappin’ bitches bitches
And rappin’ rappin’ an’ bitches until all of us switches
I swear, it’s been two years since somebody ask me who I was
I’m the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
That’s whats important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing “walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I’m a uptown nigga, ah”
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways


People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)


Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon’ tell me that she don’t dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that’s all I’m really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin’ furs like its snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that’s the shit that she like
So why am I a classic, this is who I’m trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turnin’ papers in won’t get me paid
If I don’t nothing I’mma ball
I’m countin all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah I need that, making major changes to the life I’m living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways



People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe

Look inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt and never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don’t know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


I’m trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I’m looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I’ll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


You ain’t heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don’t you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3′s in the air I can see you are – in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I’ll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it’s alive
My new year’s resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say – Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe

Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish
Hit this house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know its vacant, ya bish
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherene then went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Parked the car and then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel


Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 at the school
You know big ballin with my homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality we poor, ya bish
Another casualty at war, ya bish
Two bullets in my uncle tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish
That Louie's Burger never be the same
A louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin'
Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hoping all of em offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gone crash it when nobodies home


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel


Be the last one out to get this dough? , No Way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes?, No Way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No Way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No Way


Imagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, everyday I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em, get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel



Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That being known let me know
Let me

Seems like street lights glowing
Happen to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fares
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the streetlights glowing
Happen to be
Just like moments passing
In front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fare
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

In the streets... In the streets
I'm just not there
In the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

Seems like street lights glowing
Happen to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fares
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the streetlights glowing
Happen to be
Just like moments passing
In front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fare
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the streetlights glowing
Happen to be
Just like moments passing
In front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fare
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

In the streets... In the streets
I'm just not there
In the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair


Every morning when I wake up, uh, money on my mind
Good times and get caked up, uh, sunshine coming through my blinds
I’m living but, really though, it’s never enough
10 milli on, that's a must, living in California, everybody wanna visit for


Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Yo, it sound clever, come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA


These niggas’ll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck can’t y'all see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It’s a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I’m stressed


You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I’m forever living




My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him - some
3 W’s only for a three day run
Bitch, take them motherfucking panties off, you ain't no - nun, shit
I be living in the sky everytime I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control
California living 'til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know the priority order me Hennessey
And for my niggas OG Killa
Call it Jason Voorhees, boy he's on his job
Boy he sure be having the marks
On they mark, pretty bitches and tire marks
Let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost
For this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh
If I’m wrong then I wanna be right
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it’s not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off




Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, muthafuck your opinion
How many ways am I killing 'em, shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she’ll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I’m in a position of controlling, anything, I buy that ocean
I'm a boss I’ll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this


They want that shit, they often feind
I give it to ‘em, but in between, my time
I gotta tie shoestrings, life’s a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean toward 3 W’s in life
You know blow job need an application, eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like ‘em brown, just like my drink, the fuck you think
I don’t fuck wit’ no hand me downs, see if you fuck then its after me
You know how much I’mma make it work?
You know her dress, slip it in her purse
When you discussed your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first, Cali

 

When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hoping that you’ll survive
Gather your wind, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

When I get signed, homie I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue eyed devil with a fat ass monkey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game, made a bad bitch yours
When I get signed homie I'mma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican, run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated but I got a million dollar check, like that

We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home

Yo what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keeping it, motherfucker

What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam on your dollar
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliche and say, fuck your haters
I can see the borrow in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies with a snow white collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me feel forever baby, count it all together baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
Too much and enough both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick
And when you get the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

Lookin' down is quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top you got it)
A lot of metaphors, leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'


It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya
See ya picture, now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya


Yeah, one time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch


I'm so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need


I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Air Force stunting flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that muthafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on


I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Takin' everything slow, so slow, so slow but I do it to her


Drapped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end


Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rollin' through the city
Bumpin' that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like everything just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone

I’m livin’ in the 21st century
Doin’ something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the ’80s, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his own theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clock’s tickin’, I just count the hours
Stop trippin’, I’m trippin’ off the power
(21st century schizoid man)

The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We ain’t got nothin’ to lose, ma’fucka, we rollin’
Huh? Ma’fucka, we rollin’
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin’
Huh? I see you in the mornin’
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power
The clock’s tickin’, I just count the hours
Stop trippin’, I’m trippin’ off the power
‘Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours

And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they (21st century schizoid man)

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell ‘em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I’m an asshole? You niggas got jugs
You short-minded niggas’ thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice, brought the Dodies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He know, he so, fuckin’ gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn’t open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being prodded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin’ up with me
Takin’ my inner child, I’m fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece

Nigga, no one man should have all that power
The clock’s tickin’, I just count the hours
Stop trippin’, I’m trippin’ off the power
‘Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours

And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they (21st century schizoid man)

Holy, powers, Austin, Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin’ nation
They say I was the obamanation of Obama’s nation
Well, that’s a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day, goddammit, I’m killin’ this shit
I know damn well y’all feelin’ this shit
I don’t need yo’ pussy, bitch, I’m on my own dick
I ain’t gotta power trip, who you goin’ home with?
How ‘Ye doin’? I’m survivin’
I was drinkin’ earlier, now I’m drivin’
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin’?
I got the power, make yo’ life so excitin’ (So excitin’)

Now this’ll be a beautiful death
Jumpin’ out the window
Lettin’ everything go
Lettin’ everything go

Now this’ll be a beautiful death
Jumpin’ out the window
Lettin’ everything go
Lettin’ everything go

Now this’ll be a beautiful death
Jumpin’ out the window
Lettin’ everything go
Lettin’ everything go

Now this’ll be a beautiful death
Jumpin’ out the window
Lettin’ everything go
Lettin’ everything go

You got the power to let power come


For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
Like them black kids
In Chiraq bitch


Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it


So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass


Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it


Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doing shit
Them niggas ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action


Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it




God! God! God! God!


I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure


How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9am in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?


Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas lookin' like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowin' that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's gettin' into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lackin' synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it’s meant to be
Paranoid, always rollin' with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man



La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless

To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly

Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talkin' like it's just you and me

I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hill, man
I guess the money should have changed him
I guess I should have forgot where I came from

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

Excuse me? Was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homey, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell you who the side was

So I parallel double park that mother*** sideways
Old folks talking 'bout back in my day
But homey this is my day, class started two hours ago
Oh, am I late?

No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive

Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And then say something where you gonna end up apologin'
Let me know if it's a problem man
Aight man, holla then

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

Excuse me? Was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get passed
He don't even stop to get gas

If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of ***?

Must be the Pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, uh, dependin' how you dress her

So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam, Eve wear Nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort
'Cause when you try hard is when you die hard
Y'all homies lookin' like, why God?
When they reminisce over you, my God

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

Excuse me? Was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

Yo, I can't sing it....

I feel like singin'....

I wanna fuckin' sing...

Cuz I'm happy..
Yeah......I'm happy

Ha Ha, I got my baby back...

Yo, check it out 


Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think theres nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry 

Somtimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wasting my time? 

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 


Somtimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me 


My baby girl  keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, cuz they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side 

I act like shit don't phase me,
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive 

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 




Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singing this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mum didn't abort
Now you probly get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his momma,
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Cuz there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul,
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breaking should I just give up,
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself,
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin'hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted are nothing to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': 
3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to peoples backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', why'd I stick my penis up in?
Woulda ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted 

Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cuz my baby know's that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me 
Category:  Music

I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence 
Sometimes, I did the same 

If these walls could talk

Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway 
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out 
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey 
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play 
And shes plays only when you tell her no 


If these walls could talk 
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you 
If these walls could talk 
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it 

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good 
No boat I float better than he would 
No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth 
But your flood can be misunderstood 
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment 
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension 
Me? I’m just a tenant 
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute 
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation 
Interior pink, color coordinated 
I interrogated every nook and cranny 
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me 
These walls want to cry tears 
These walls happier when I’m here 
These walls never could hold up 
Everytime I come around demolition might crush 

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep 
Yelling at me continuously I can see 
Your defense mechanism is my decision 
Knock these walls down that’s my religion 
Walls feeling like they ready to close in 
I suffocate then catch my second wind 
I resonate in these walls 
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls 
I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in 
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest 
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them 
I’m not involved I’d rather diss them 
I’d rather call all you put your wall up 
Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush 

If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late 
Your destiny accepted your fate 
Burn accessories and stash them where they are 
Take the recipe, the bible and god 
Wall telling you that commissary is low 
Race wars happening no calling CO 
No calling your mother to save you 
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable 
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch 
Walls is telling me you a bitch 
You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them 
That sentence so important 
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me" 
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me 
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life 
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night 
So when you play this song rewind the first verse 
About me abusing my power so you can hurt 
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny 
About me and her in the after hours of the morning 
About her baby daddy currently serving life 
And how she think about you until we meet up at night 
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her 
And how she fucking on a famous rapper 
Walls could talk 

I remember you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence 
Sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screaming in a hotel room

Yeahhh, torture motherfucker what?
(Torture nigga what?)
What?
I'll fuckin
I'll fuckin tie you to a fuckin bedpost
with your ass cheeks spread out and shit
Right?
Put a hanger on a fuckin stove and let that shit sit there
for like a half hour
Take it off and stick it in your ass slow like
Tssssssss

Yeah, I'll fuckin
Yeah I'll fuckin lay your nuts on a fuckin dresser
Just your nuts layin on a fuckin dresser
And bang them shits with a spiked fuckin bat
Ooooohhhh
Whassup? BLAOWWW!!

I'll fuckin
I'll fuckin pull your fuckin tongue out your fuckin mouth
and stab the shit with a rusty screwdriver, BLAOWW!!
I'll fuckin

I'll fuckin
I'll fuckin hang you by your fuckin dick
off a fuckin twelve sto-story building out this motherfucker

I'll fuckin
I'll fuckin
sew your asshole closed, and keep feedin you
and feedin you, and feedin you, and feedin you

(Your soul have just been taken through the 36 chambers of death, kid)

(*coughing*)
(Word to mother, Method Man signing off, peace)

Cole
Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back man
As I do so well

Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngen' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deep and
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said "You ever had sex before"
Damn

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no

I wrote back and said "Of course I had sex before"
Knowing I was frontin'
I said I'm like a pro baby
Knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know that
So she done wrote back and told me
"Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'"
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you laying on the bed
Teacher please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like "Yeah baby sound like a plan"
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned
Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin
Fuck

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no

You know that feelin' when you you finna bone for the first time
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying "God don't let me bust quick"
I'm watching pornos trying to see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in her crib now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
"I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you a pro, but baby be gentle cause"

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no



It's amazing
I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening

I'm exhausted
Barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)

I'm a monster
I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong, yeah

I'm a problem
That'll never
Ever be solved

And no matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)

I'm a monster
I'm a maven
I know this world is changin'

Never gave in
Never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'.

So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'

(Young Jeezy)

I'm amazin'
Yeah I'm all that
If I ain't on my grind
Then what you call that?

Victorious
Yeah we warriors
We make history
Strive of Victory

Standing at my podium
I'm trying watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure
You even let the feds get cha!

I'm amazin'
Born on the full moon
I was bred to get in
No spoon

That's why I'm so goose
Summer time, no juice
Big family, small house no rooms

They like oh god!
Why you go so hard?
Look what he's been through
He deserves an applause

So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'

ssss Shady aftermath
G-Unit! Haha

()
Cause we came here to set this party off right
let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in thru the front we'll come thru the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without a least sayin' good bye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right scream one last time.

Get your ass up for the Doctor
One more time Get your ass up for the Doctor
come on now, here we go
cliffhanger it's another club banger
got you hangin on the edge of your seat
get on down

Time's up, game's over, you lose i win
bout to show these knuckle heads how to do this here
oooh yeah, new year
next phase begin
look who's got you goin crazy again
i'm a trend, i set one every time i'm in
i go out and just come back in full circle again
if you a fad that means it's something that we already had
but once your gone you don't come back
too bad you're off the map now
radar can't even find you
we stay on the grind
you slip we out grind you
you walk around mad you let your anger blind you
we walk around just playin the violin behind you
enough with all the pissin and moanin, whinin and bitchin
sit observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
why i'm sittin multi-platinum, later 3 diamond worldwide
we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin

(chorus)

When Dr. Dre says "Crunk!"  you will get it crunk (get it crunk, crunk, crunk)
and when 50 Cent says "Jump!" you will get on one foot and jump! (jump, jump, jump)
Applause is tremendous , we drop you all the senses
i don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
we keep the party rockin off the hinges
we ain't showin off we're just goin off popular consensus
but critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all washed up
knock it off! Who the fuck is Doc impressin?
Doc is this, Doc is that
you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cockadock cause Doc left you all guessin
so DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?)
we gonna have this muthafucka hoppin in a second (uh huh)
that's why we always save the best cut last
to make the scratch and mix for it like fresh cut glass
We swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
spoke to an generation of angry teenagers whom if it wasn't for rap
to bridge the gap may be raised to be racists
who may have never got to see our faces
grace the cover of Rollin Stone pages
broke down barriers of language and races
just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
to pass the mic don't need ta play back and forth like 
the hot potato game or somethin

()

50 Cent come on!
Now snap, hands up
you know how we do, we make the club jump everywhere we go
it's no secret, everybody know 
when Dre's involved there's plenty of money involved 
and plenty honeys involved 
it's sunny Sundays and palm trees, Cali
every day is just another party from The Valleys
all the way to the "make my" alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the Grand Finale
now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
blaze a pound of weed 6 days about the week
you can catch me in the studio bangin out the beatsta
provide ya with the heat that keep blazin out the speakers 
so never say never cause Shady Aftermath together along with G-Unit 
records presents the return of the "The Doc" (O'Shay)
no one can do it better we tear that club up and leave without a shred of evidence
and a...

We gonna make Dre do it. Ha ha! 
50 Cent  G-Unit

And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong

I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags!
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

She find pictures in my email
I sent this girl a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

And I always find
Yeah, I always find

Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know

Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

(Pusha T)

24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha?
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, they wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes wit' a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!

(Kanye)

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know it did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me
I'm guessin' you're at an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

And I always find
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Complexion (two-step) 
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love) 
Complexion (two-step) 
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love) 

Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun 
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done 
Sneak (dissin’) 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga 
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you 
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down 
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention 

Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' Sun 
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run 
Sneak (dissin') 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga 
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you 
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down 
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention 
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival 
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival 
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken 
By different shades of faces 
Then wit told me, "You're womanless, woman love the creation" 
It all came from God then you was my confirmation 
I came to where you reside 
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes 
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with... 

You like it, I love it 
You like it, I love it 

Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2pac 
Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die 
Color of your skin, color of your eyes 
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby 
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey 
All my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave 
12 years of age, thinkin’ my shade too dark 
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid 
And forcin’ my dark side like a young George Lucas 
Light don’t mean you smart, bein’ dark don’t make you stupid 
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin’ “Woohah!” 
Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored 
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times 
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion 
It ain’t complex to put it in context 
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context 
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest 
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed 
Ain’t no stress, jigga boos wanna be 
I ain’t talkin’ Jay, I ain’t talkin’ Bey 
I’m talkin’ days we got school watchin’ movie screens 
And spike yourself esteem 
The new James Bond gon’ be black as me 
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea 
And it’s all beautiful to me 
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens 
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing 

Barefoot babies with no cares 
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car? 
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse 
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth


You still love me?
Take this. 
You ready? 1.. 2.. 3! 


The more you, put me through,
The more it makes me wanna come back to you,
You say you hate me, I just love you more,
You don't want me, I just want you more,
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
I know it's sad but it's making me happy,
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
Cause you love me, and I love you more.


It's sick, but who could ever predict,
We'd be doin' the same shit,
We say we do it for our baby but we don't,
We do it for us, it's lust,
Cause neither one of us trusts each other,
So we fuck 'til we bust,
Then we cuss each other, out,
We know what it's about,
Shout 'til I throw you out the house,
You throw me out the house,
I throw you on the couch,
Punch you in the mouth,
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,
And apologize after,
Laughter, pain, it's insane,
We're back in the same chapter again,
And it's sad but it's true,
When I'm layin' here with you,
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.




Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,
It makes me wanna just take you,
And just throw you on the bed,
And fuck you like I don't even know you,
You fuck other people, and I fuck other people,
You a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,
We're both evil in our ways,
But neither one of us would ever admit it,
Cause one of us would have one up on the other,
So forget it,
We can make accusations, people spread rumors,
But they ain't got proof,
'Til they do it's just the two of us,
It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me,
But you gotta believe me to a degree,
Cause true indeed if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,
Yeah I would cause the sex is too damn good,
If I ran who would I run to,
That would be this soft and warm,
So it's off and on, usually more off than on,
But at least we know that we share this common bond,
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on,
I hope, the only reason that I cope,
Is cause of that fact,
And plus I can bust in that,
And that's why...




I could never understand it,
That's why I don't try,
From junior high until we both die,
It's silly ho why must we try,
Is it really so rough,
That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,
Try to pull each other's legs,
Until the other begs,
We're liein' to ourselves,
That's the beauty of it yeah,
Cause we truly love each other,
That's why we always fight,
And all we do is shove each other,
Every other fuckin' night,
And it's clear it ain't gonna change,
It's pent up rage,
We both have,
We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,
We've both been,
Someone else's someone else,
Problem is neither one wants help,
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed,
Our family's mixed up,
There's a baby sister in the mix,
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,
On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,
All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,
But I won't be made a fool of,
If this is true love,
You wouldn't do what,
You did last time,
You wouldn't screw up,
This time,
Cause this time girl,
I'm telling you what,
You do it again I'm fucking you up,
No matter what...


What you say, what you do,
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,
No matter where you run, I'll be right there,
Right behind you, in your nightmares,
All the flowers, and the candy,
All the times that you threw it back at me,
You told me you hate me, you're gonna hate me more,
When you find out, can't escape me whore.



You know a lotta girls be...thinking my songs about them, but
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...


Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say you da fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate,
Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the matt and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

Cause,



Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffin theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 

Uhh, ah yea
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money
You know who you are, I got ya

Ay yo DJ respect let’s get em
Veterans like how dare all of this arrogance
What you expect when all they do draw comparisons between us and Americans
And tell me go hard well I am going harder now 
Bumping Shawn Carter cause there aint a Shawn Carter now feel me
Get with it I’m trying to overthrow a nation using Phade To Black as a niggas only motivation
I’m picking and choosing an army and thinking of moving my talent disprove it
Let’s show her heads who’s in
And if you must know this year I’m going for the gusto plus though seat feeling like a bus load
So take me as I am I have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that parade love me
I’m a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for trinity Chris word
See my role models role with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough then the whole lotto
 So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mamoses with the clique quad
What up Nikko Jordan Lucky and TJ nicknamed the night fox clique we take it easy
You prime ministers claim you repping the team I need a mother fucking president to represent me

Just the two of us.. 


Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us..

Just me and you baby
is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby

So this is it?
This is what I wished for
This isnt how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just this shit'd be different
But something changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffing it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldnt quit
I just wanted a little bit
Them it turned me to a monster 
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert
I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sowing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no one for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in between
You either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3 years later they go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just aint pass yet
A couple more years that shit'll be illmatic 
And 8 years later I'm still at it
Divorced, remarried
A felon,a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk


So be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold
I said be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might ot know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold

I got a letter from a fan that said
He's been praying for me
Everyday, and for some reason it's been weighing on my mind heavy
Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But some thing told me to go ahead and open it but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you
You didn't pray for me when i was local
And as i lay these vocals
I think of all the shit i had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you atleast a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but i've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride hasn't it?
Just watching it from an opposite stand point
Man boy's got to look... nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now on how
To describe this shit
It's just like  a vibe you get
Go ahead  and bop to it just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit

Things been so crazy and hected
I should of have got back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better any how...


So if you gotta go
If there's anythin I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you looking for a purpose


You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm all singing karaoke, further than I ever been


So if you gotta go...
If there's anyway I can help


Isn't it ironic,
That the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
And tell's me my life is to much and moves to atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you would choose some where that had somebody that you know
I'm alway's up to late
I worry bout you there alone in a place you call your home warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy cause no man wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest but the first cut is the deepest
I tryed to keep us together you was busy keeping secrets
Secrets you would tell everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money
I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm suprise you couldn't tell


I was only trying to get ahead 
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And your looking for a purpose


I was only trying to get ahead 
But the spotlight makes you nervous...

Fuck it,
Ay,
Do or Die, new arrival,
Holla at my niggas,
You survive you's alive, yo,
Now either you follow me and ride, or you's a rival.
The difference between you and I is you a model, you posing.
But who am I though?
The mulatto out for that lotto,
Money coming soon, the newest model,
Your crew is hollow,
The type of niggas got more dick, chew and swallow.
Your girl told me shoot in her face, she suicidal,
Oh shucks, you niggas is closed, you fold up.
I'm from the Ville, niggas get killed over four bucks,
Thank God we made it, my niggas, we grown up,
Now we crazy over that bread, call us the "dough-nuts," uh,
More sluts once the money blows up,
But them hoes stop if the dough drops,
I won't stop though, a chip off the 'ol block.
I'm from a city where niggas hole blocks,
Leave you looking like old socks, damn,
Cops patrol blocks, spotting on us,
The boys is rotten, I know they want us,
Probably arrest a nigga, get a bonus,
You kill a nigga, get promoted,

Shit is crazy, girls getting babies before they get diplomas,
So much I just go nuts,
Niggas telling me slow up,
Remember that,
I'm tryna get where that cheddar at,
Y'all don't hear me,
Always somebody that don't want you getting cheese, yo,
This whole bullshit is like Tom and Jerry,
I'm kinda very raw, niggas can't deny facts,
If you black they sending you to jail or Iraq,
Honor is something you can't sell or buy back,
Niggas don't like bragging, they 9-11 fly cats,
Hijack niggas, "Get up out your whip nigga, strip!
I want it all- ice on your wrists and the kicks,"
This shit happens, I ain't just rapping, believe it yo,
They got streets in the city police won't even go,
Peep it though, uh,
It ain't no secret, niggas beefing cause my ego so big,
It got me speaking like I'm diesel, like I'm devil, oh,
Niggas know my stylo, I ain't tweaking, I am lethal though,
Have your daddy looking for you,
This ain't Finding Nemo though.
Let me slow it down, dumb it down, y'all warned,
The son came up out that womb, yo, a star is born.
If real recognize real, y'all are foreign,
My team run a play on your bitch and we all scoring, yea!

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause


They loving the crew


Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'mma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know




Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
(If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city)

Damn those words are scary
those words are scary virqin mary 
I just tell her to spare me
I was in 

Oh oh oho.
damn, here we go again.
Oh oh oho.
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam,

now everything I'm not, made me everything I am.
damn, here we go again.
people talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am.

I never be picture-perfect-Beyonce
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet
He was as black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as his beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.am
Let me know if you feel it man
'cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

and I'm back to tear it up
haters, start your engines
I hear 'em gearin' up
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops
they forget to get their haircut
OK fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
baggy clothes, Reebok's, or Adidas
can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
so say goodbye to the NAACP award
goodbye to the India.Arie award
they'd rather give me the nigga-please award
but I'll just take the I-got-a-lot-of-cheese award

damn, here we go again.
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I know that people wouldn't usually rap this
but I got the facts to back this
just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
man, killing's some wack shit
oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
he got changed over his chains, a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
the church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
the slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay
my 15 seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today

damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am 

(Sing about me)


When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em"
I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'm a push it, wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope -


Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it section.80, the message resemble Brenda's Got a Baby
What's crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'm a need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that "Sorry for your loss shit"
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'm a get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...


When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the cent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help me mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm sure not why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'm a rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that put me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "it need to be told
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her soul"
Exactly would have happened if I hadn't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?


Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me



(Dying of Thirst)

Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't?
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently
But they couldn't, bring her back
Who got the footage? channel 9
Cameras looking, it's hard to channel your energy
When you know you're crooked
Banana clip split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams of ballin like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst

What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world, " my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling
Backwards my mama say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"



*
Yeah
I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time, like
What it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then, but
I can probably tell you a lil somethin' now


Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin', I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels and they silencin' you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here
I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch chrome green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years
It's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap
It's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' dranks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like (vocalizes)
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring 07
Second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is whack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at the dinner table and say "my baby's famous and I knew it"

And it wasn't nothin' to it
I'm drawin' and drawin' till the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out


Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF


Closer to my dreams (Miss Andreena Mill)
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah (Yeah man)
I feel it in my sleep (Sing it to 'em baby)
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams


Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progress
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video has made everything right with ex (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Too many rappers and not enough-
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
They can't
Play pen drop out
The gray ten drop out
Summer 05 with the gray Benz drop out
Charcoal charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the awful dodger
Showed her I'mma
I told her I'mma
Bout to get my run-on so hold the commas
Times changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home



Closer to my dreams 
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah 
I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either crip or piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and,.. real talk, and


This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, y'know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hold up
Where you from? "How-bang"
Where you stay? "Westside", that's a piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed to cross Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the hot ninety-five, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but


This is why they fuck with me (I told you nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, y'know?


This is why they fuck with me 
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

So there you have it
But I'm a leave you with this
An OG once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I'm gone

Ooww Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you’ve all been waiting for ..
In this corner : weighing 175 pounds,
with a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,
the undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world :
Slim Shady!

 : Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don’t act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh Uh-oh, bitch3s hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where’s the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I notice there’s so many of them
and there’s really not that many of us.
And ladies love us, my posse’s kicking up dust.
It’s on till the break of dawn
and we’re starting this party from dusk

Ok … let’s go

Back wit Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you’ll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the fumunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
Its a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed.
Bitch3s lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us. Its ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the sh-t
gets worse then worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
Its elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say we're the center of attention its true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here’s the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio’s back on you hoes.

 : Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don’t act like a snobby model.
You just hit the lotto.
Uh-oh Uh-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I notice there’s so many of them
and there’s really not that many of us.
And ladies love us, my posses kicking up dust.
Its on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

Dr Dre
They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain’t got to tell me why you’re sick cuz I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.
I’m an itch that they cant scratch, they sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cuz over and above all, its just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I’ll be dammed, just f*cked around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end
Lets cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know.
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision.
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

And I take great pleasure in introducing: 50 Cent

50 Cent
It’s bottle after bottle
The money ain’t a thang when you party with me
Its what we into its simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn’t believe
I’m the napalm the bomb the don i’m King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I’m so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the shaun dawn burn marajauan do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man i’m caking you know i don’t give a f*ck
I spend it like it don’t mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherf*cker i’m grown
I stunt i style i flash the sh-t
I gets what the f*ck i want so what I trick
Fat ass burgundy bags classy sh-t Jimmy Cho shoes
I say move a bitch move

This sh-t was all I knew,
you and me only,
and I did it all for you,
still you were lonely,
we coulda worked it out,

uhh, but i guess things change,
its funny how someone elses success brings pain,
when ya no longer involved that person has it all,
and you just stuck standing there,

But, Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,
Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,


Yeah,
ever since Ive been long gone,
I traded in my senorita for a microphone,
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see,
your life is good but me and you its catastrophe,
if I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied,
I need a paramedic girl, Im feeling paralysed,
if I could choose, you will always be a friend to me,
the more money I made you acting like my enemy,
its crazy, I cant help it if you feel ashamed,
lots of pressure will turn you into my diamond babe,
how can something so familiar be so strange,
closest friends get estranged when the status change,
ahh, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at,
and my whole wild is the only one that had my back,
you were the perfect girl, now it seems we dont match,
is it the money, want me to give it back,




Uhh, i am the topic of conversation, this a celebration,
lets toast to the fact that I moved out my momma basement,
to a condo downtown because its all about location,
I sit and drink wine and watch californication of life,
you shoulda been here to kick it with me,
we coulda split this whole thing up 50/50,
but now im at the 40/40 getting b-tches tipsy,
killing sh-t the ever so talented Mr Ripley,
how I go from being the man that you argue with,
to me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest sh-t,
I should wanna go back to the one I started with,
but Im addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit,
yeah, just ask me how things are coming along,
you can tell me that you never heard none of my songs,
long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen,
cos whats a star when its most important fan is missing?

()

Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your motherfucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?, cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6

 1:
Aiyyo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, cause they be actin maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming pills or roaches, we sprayed and disinfects
and twist the necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass in a track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
I'm Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

 2:
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, some fruit to stomp,and then two feet to rinse
I greet intensive ladies, I spoil all your fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the only one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My a capella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

 3:
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility 
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tractical, tactful, track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
I'm Infinite

:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite(x2)


Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great then I falls, my insides crawl
and I clam up (wham) I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road


I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road


I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, and the same pants
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road




You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't the skillest
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each on of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road



On lonely nights I start to fade(x2)

Her loves a thousand miles away(x2)

Memories made in the coldest winter, goodbye my friend, will I eva love again

Memories made in the coldest winter....

It's 4 am and I can't sleep(x2)

Her love is all that I can see(x2)

Memories made in the coldest winter, goodbye my friend , will I eva love again

Memories made in the coldest winter....

Winter(x2)

Goodbye my friend, will I eva love again(x3)

Yeah, you see 'em look, baby, let 'em look, give you cold looks cuz we look cold
Yeah, you heard about all the word of mouth, don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world, loss in the world 'till you finally let that thing gooo
You wanna check-in to the heartbreak hotel but sorry we're closed


HOOK:

Clubbing hard, fuckin women, there ain't much to do

That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day

Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

Seven...grams in the blunt?
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt

And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit

Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar

Hotter than a middle eastern climate climate

We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same

Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that noila got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do

Intro]
 I wanna hit line drives...
 Wanna lose weight and keep eating...
 For you...
 Hey, whats up doc?


 Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
 You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
 To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth
 I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
 The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
 Looked in the mirror, then realized I-I-I had something to prove
 You told me "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
 Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the road


 And I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), and I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
 And I run it, (Yeah! Blow!), and I run it, (Yeah! Blow!)
 That's ironic, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
 That's ironic, (Y-Yeah! Blow!), I run it, (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)
 Salt all in my wounds
 Hear my tears all in my tunes
 Let my life loose in this booth
 Just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused
 And I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), and I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
 And I run it, (Y-Yeah! Blow!), and I run it (Yeah! Blow!) That's ironic


 Liberation...leader...

 This shit make a nigga just wanna write
 Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
 Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
 Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
 I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
 Tell a story that I'll never glory 25
 Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
 And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
 Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
 Nobody gon' abide by your rule
 Nobody holding your gun, how come your tongue say killa then kill my mood
 Light speed living in the world you know
 Little old me, feeling like a live wire
 Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
 Til' I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
 I am from the bottom of the jungle
 Living in the bottom of the food chain
 When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
 A new name, want stripes, and you and zebra look alike
 Hope another homicide don't numb you and none do
 Things we will never learn soon
 In the era where we wanna earn soon
 That's a error, you can smell it in the air and everybody really doomed
 That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
 All y'all can suck my dick
 All them days at the county building
 Now I'm 'bout to make my mama rich
 Cartoons and (cereal!) I ain't felt this good since
 Scrooge McDuck, (here we go!) Elementary hood shit




 This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
 Even with a pot to piss in
 I'mma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
 Dismiss any business of yours
 Discounts never did amount to a check
 That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
 Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
 AKs for the whole hood
 House lick went down perfect
 Two shots to the head he deserved it
 I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
 Dark Wing Duck lost service
 Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
 Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
 I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
 This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
 Emerging on everbody corner (dash for it)
 Get a toe tag when you play tag with a task of a new (task force)
 Everybody wanna know my life
 How did I make it (past yours)
 Well let me tell you like this
 I've been running this shit since (I asked for it)
 Cartoons and cereal




 Salt all in my wounds
 Hear my tears all in my tunes
 Let my life loose in this booth just for you
 Mufucka hope y'all amused!
 I did wrong, karma came
 Crackers gave me ball and chain
 Friends, enemies all the same
 State, fed, both can hang
 Nobody can mute me, but I never said nobody can't shoot me
 Just another stat to the white folks
 Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
 Everyday feel like the one before
 Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
 If you do what you always done
 Then you get what you always got
 You dumb buffoons!
 I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
 For about the past 72 hours
 Hand on my heart, face to the hood
 I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
 Yeah this me, no mic
 No cameras, no lights, just pain
 Mama how much trauma can I sustain?
 Dirty money come with lots of stains
 Road to riches come with lots of lanes
 Just another player with lots of game
 Never had shit, got lots to gain...

Just another player with lots of game
 Never had shit, got lots to gain


Yeah Grandmama
Told you I won't let you down
Told you I won't let this rap game change me, right?


When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
Oh no you'll neva let me down,
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)


Yo, yo first I snatched the street then I snatched the charts,
First had they ear now I hav they're heart,
Rappers came and went,
I've been hear from the start,
Seen them put it together
Watch them take it apart,
See the Rovers roll up wit ribbons
I've seen them re-poed, re-sold and re-driven
So when I reload, he holds #1 position
When u hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin
It's plain to see
Nigga's can't f*** wit me
Cuz ima be that nigga fo life
This is not an image
This is God given
This is hard liven
Mixed wit crystal sipping
It's the most consistent
Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy




I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit that seat where white folks ain't wanna us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
With that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music
And I just don't be feeling it
Racism still alive they just be concealing it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptised at least 3 or 4 times
But in the land where nigga's praise
Yukons and getting paid
It gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than do-rags to get your waves
Noting sadder than that day my girl father past away
So I promised to Mr Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And u know I gotta thank u for they way that she was brought up
And I know that u were smiling when u see that car I bought her
And u sent tears from heaven when u seen my car get balled up
But I can't complaint what the accident did to my Left Eye
Cuz look what a accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah and now romeo must die
I know a got angels watching me from the other side




We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this
That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental
Vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that is not what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte
I'm tryina give us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you, my many inspirations
When I say I can't, let you or self down
If I were of the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life in my grip
I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out




Who else you know been hot this long,
(Oh Ya, you know we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong,
(The ROC is in the building)
Built the ROC from a pebble, pedalled rock before I met you,
Pedalled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special,
Let you tell that man I'm falling,
Well somebody must've caught him,
Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em,
Number one albums, what I got like four of dem,
More of dem on the way,
The Eight Wonder on the way,
Clear the way, I'm here to stay,
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that, this and Jay,
Dissin' Jay 'ill get you mased,
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious,
Six Hail Maries, please Father forgive us,
Young, the Archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas,
The way y'all all follow Jigga,
Hov's a living legend and I tell you why,
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov still alive.

Intro:
Where's my snare
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you eva been hated, or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin', and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigga me, but they'll neva figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probley sick of me now
Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ha!

I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Imma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a coupla months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side,
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work
Wit her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I grew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't't't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, MA!
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, MA!
But guess what, ya gettin' olda now and it's cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your FUNERAL
See whets hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yaself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get,
You selfish bitch
I hope you fuckin' burn in in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Let's get it, I can't wait to trick man
It's gonna be so sweet
Summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine

Still like, "Can you hit it with your OVO goose on?"
I'm like, "What are you on?"

You know I got another bar for ya
I'mma chill baby, we don't want the devil in this bitch, nah

I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on

Comin' from the 6 side
Where niggas goin' shower posse just to get by
Stay true never switch sides, yea, the game turn me into this guy
Yea, and now every time Drake out
Cameras always flashing tryna put me on the Takeout
Crib in Calabasas man I call that shit the safe house
Thirty minutes from L.A. the shit is way out
But these days that's where I'm stayin'
You can hear it in my voice I'm goin' way in
Yea, OB that my brother like a Wayans
Just know I only show up if you payin', nigga

She loves to get on, she loves to get 2

You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so bad girl, you're so awful
I fuck you right in my office
You go tell your friends you're honest
That's why all your friends are on
You know you made me a promise
We're not in this for commitment
Your man's gone and you don't miss him
Book you flights and confirmation
Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasing that paper
Even though you're exhausted you're still gonna make it girl
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so, you're so
You love to get 2 on

And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know that I put you on
And you know, that's something yo

Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker. Boys playin' Playstation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?

Yeah, sound sound sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this?
How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions
We ain't doing no interview


Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?


Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There is vomit on his sweater already
Moms spaggehti he's nervous
But on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over BLOW!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that
But he's broke, he's so sad that he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home
That's when it's back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody, better go capture this moment
And hope it don't collapse on him


You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better


Soul's escapin' through this hole's that is gaping
This world is mines for the taking
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring
But superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads got him
He knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold ya nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold prada
They moved on to the next shmo who flows
Who nose dove and sold nada
And so the so proper
His toll, it unfolds and I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on
Duh duh doe, duh doe, dah dah dah dah




No more games, I'ma change for due called rage
Tear this muthafuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped writin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Pfifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's gettin' even harder tryin' to feed and water
My seed plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a pre-madonna
Baby momma drama, screamin' on her
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotony 
Has gotten me to the point
I'm like a snail, I've got to formulate a plot
Or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only muthafuckin' option, failure's not
Momma love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot
Feet fail me not
Cause maybe the only opportunity that I got




Duh doo
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again
Soon as you get in

VERSE 1:

HEY THERE...PRETTY GIRL. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU GOT AND I DONT... 

BLAME YOU AT ALL,YOU CANT RESIST IT. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE LIGHTS SO

CHORUS (1x):


END!!!


Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you


I'm just so fucking depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump,
but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up, 
in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided to just pick this pen
Up to try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, 
I need a new outlet
And I know some shits so hard to swallow, 
but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you got to walk a thousand miles


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humour
Everything's so tense and gloom, I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room
Just as soon as I walk in, It's like all eyes on me, 
so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that it then it opens the door for conversation, 
like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, 
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, 
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack, and half of them ain't even funny,
like "AAHHHHH!
Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn!"
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell, hell
We don't gotta trade our shoes, and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves, and flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could of either just sat on my ass, and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in, and get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never 
did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me, keep making that face til it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there holding my tounge, 
tryna talk like BLEGH!
Then I stuck my tounge on that frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson then, 
'cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story, not just based off my description
Cause where you see it form where you're sitting, 
is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a miles in eachothers shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet


In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you

Yeah, to my babies, stay strong, dad will be home soon
And to the rest of the world... God gave you them shoes, to fit you
So put them on and wear them... be yourself man, 
be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny... 
don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful


I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky


Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the 'No Smoking' sign with a blunt and a Marl'
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like three summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Mayback
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow


I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky


Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
+My life, my love+ that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never one to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule wore headset nine
Puttin' known ass on shelves
Waitin' paitently I ask myself
Qhere I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God "Man why'd you had to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure


I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky


I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say "Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I all had that snatched from me
And all the faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me
Cuz nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't bee a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off


I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky


I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me brother for a ride




Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah.


I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far


I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
"Cleaning Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause, Ma,
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to Chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away it drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old,
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but




'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for "Cleaning Out My Closet", at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though,
'cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own,
But now the medications taken over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have,
'cause one thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths,
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest,
I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my mama...




I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girl
So I never say, "Goodbye, cruel world."
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die



I want a new life 

Uh,
I'm just so far gone, 
October's own, 
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong,
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown,
parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne

You know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A
Pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
You know, so... forgive me
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

Uh,
And life is so insane, 
Look what I've became, 
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why yo girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain

Me, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man.


Yeah, uh-huh


Uh, hardly home but always reppin,
You hardly on and always second,
When I'm awake you always restin,
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question,
I, I'm doin classic shit in all my sessions,
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin,
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions,
I just always did my own thing,
Now I run the game, you stupid muddasuckas
I see all this money through my ohio state buck eyes,
Shippin goin good, but good can turn to better,
Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
come on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
come on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Yeah, wrong way down the one way,
Women don't get saved round me even on a sunday,
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who,
Then they meet my pop and tell 'I'm ''Drake is just a younger you'',
And shawty wanna party so don't let yo girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ, of me givin her mouth-to-mouth,
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her,
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcom X an Martin Luther
I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady,
They just loose to love, those are tennis games lady,
Have you countin money goin dufflebag-crazy,
Sippin on Pink Floyd an puffin Wayne Brady,
Damn, who's line is it anyways,
I'm in the daze, you been amazed, y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage,
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze,
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right,
You look nice, and yo frame, makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well alright, guess I might, know what fuck it yes I will,
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin less than real
Put it to you right


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
come on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest,
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused,
The gangstas recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's,
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus,
Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this ibomb, I palm
The game like it's a spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great mike,
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this gon be a great night,
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white,
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,
This that major moment you've been waitin on for too long,
The best that ever did it an doin it on a new song,
UGK an Young Money too strong
Down in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


I am the leather jacket, black glasses, all american bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket an you, you just a bag boy
Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you neva had boy
Hate an I will leave ya chest the color of my flag boy
Super bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
An I keep that toaster you can come an be my strudel biiiitch
I'm so uptown, an mothafucker if you aint don't go uptown,

And now I'm on that rock-shit
But why they let me in I'm a start shootin at a mosh pit, haha
Fuck is you talkin bout, weezy in ya mouth now

It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that

Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on




(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
> Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will serve you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?


(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right


(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right
Aw Yeah


Windshield, rappers are like gnats
They're gettin' splattered 'pon the windshield
Fallin' down like London Bridge, my blade split your onion head
Axe that like Paul Bunyan, Meth prefers the gun instead
Bong bong, put a hole inside your head

 x2
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


How come the streets don't want me to live?
Plus my niggas keep tellin' me fibs
But the devil done poisoned my wiz
I'm doin' this for my family and kids
I'm tryna be wealthy, take my time right and stay healthy
Said it before but I don't think nobody felt me
Yo tried to understand this hand that this life dealt me
I'm on the verge of a whole new makeover
My fake friends, they can take it like a takeover
I'm ready to eat, I'm ready to grip it
Got enemies everywhere, I got chicks that's wicked
Sick shit, niggas doin' wicked ass wig shit
Bid shit, tellin' jakes that I had the biscuit
Niggas be wantin' my leftovers
I'm like a general that died and lost some of his best soldiers
I burn holsters and I kill that dirt religion
Murk that pigeon and I shoot the television


Got that trey pound on you, run down on you
Hard boiled nigga, Clan top soil
My fam straight royal, I'mma die loyal
When them shooters come for you, better throw your flag 'em
I'm pure gun oil, let 'em see that hand cannon
Foundation strong, never ride a bandwagon
Andrew Jacksons, hand-to-hand transaction
Cops jumped out, caught him with his pants saggin'
Criminal individuals up in here
Wild like the theme park ride called The Buccaneer
Weed in the Tupperware, throw you off the upper tiers
Suweeee, I got all my niggas up in here

 x2


Imagine the sound of your face scrapin' up against the gate
Of a barbed wire fence, this is barbed iron fist
Heartthrob, iron dick, hoes slob the nob quick
This is odd, so throw it in your iPod quick


Lifeless activity, constant movement
Buyin' elasticity, such improvement
Sword held to where it collapses inward
Spillin' rhymes if it's Shaolin vineyards
RZA had a mixture, then he added sound to the picture
Co-author rewrote the scripture
Math worked from birth, doubled the net worth
Amplified in the time machine of early Earth
A two-way radio, simple yet complex
Receivers, transmitters, interest to contacts
The emergence of the earliest atoms
Transform to a level extremely hard to fathom
Same soup, different bowl, Wu ceramics
Same group on them large-scale dynamics
A wave triggered the burst, glass was shattered
Galactic matter served on a graphic platter

 x2


Overachiever, power hungry overeater
I95, whip fly like an overseer
I'm overconfident but some might say I'm overeager
Or overzealous, especially when it's over cheeba

My sneakers' so cold, can't wear 'em 'less you hold the heater
Can't push me over either, that go for dojas
I ain't got no love for posers neither, keep my composure
I'm focused, tryna roll the reefer, let's turn it up
Forget the cope, I'm tryna blow the speaker, that's all he wrote
One verse could turn your soul to ether
It's time you gave me my respects just like the old Aretha, Mr. Meth

 x2

Wake up Mr. West 



Uh, Yeah, Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah



And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way,
So this is in the name of love, like Robert says
Before you ask me to get a job today, can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS,
So I guess we just pray like the minister say,
Allah o Akbar and throw em some hot cars,
Things we see on the screen are not ours,
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far,
Where im from, the dope boys is the rock stars,
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars,
I guess they want us all behind bars.
I know it.


Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)


They say people in your life are seasons,
And anything that happen is for a reason,
And niggas guns a clappin and keep to squeezin',
And Gran (Grandma) keep prayin' and keep believin',
And Jesus and one day that ya see him,
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him,
The devil is alive I feel him breathin',
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin',
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us,
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down,
Now my lil cousin smokin those cigarettes now,
His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now,
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out...
Im Stickin around....


Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

(Cuz every worthless word we get more far away, and nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)





This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havn’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our seperate ways
So i’m single...
Thinking about what we had and missing you
But I aint santa, I got something for these bad b*tches too
I mean paprazzi on me trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthaf*ckin heart out, its drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me do I ever cross your mind
Because all this sh*t is new to me, i’m learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good
I know that n*ggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed
I promise to stay the same


I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest


(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me

(I'm doin my thing 3x)
I'm tryna be unforgettable...


This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say fo' life yall say fo'ever
Its hard but it's fair I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The names young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’m gon need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers

(?) so whats the deali young done everything in the A but f*ck chillin
So welcome to my life no two days the same
Like for yall to meet the love of my life her names the game


I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest


(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I'm doin my thing 3x)
I'm tryna be unforgettable...

Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit at home, I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid I'mma die before I get where I'm going
I know I'mma be alone
I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta hit a road
I just gotta know the road

Something is said, don't say that again

{just pull the plug!}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
(repeat all 2x)


Hand me an 8
Beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world {i'm here}
And shit on brandy and mase
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill {ahhh}
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot
And people goin' feel me cuz i'ma still be
The mad rapper whether i got money or not {yup}
As long as i'm on pills, and i got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin' makin' fun of your yacht
But i would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in the source
And a wardrobe i can afford
Otherwise i might get sent up back-strike in a ford
And you wonder what the fuck i need more vicadive
Everybody's pissin' me off; even a no limit tank looks like
A middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit i'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would i kill you and jump in a grave and bury myself

{just pull the plug!}
People say that i'm a bad influence

I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than rosco beating james tar senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {ouch ouch}
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that i used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, i kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that i failed 9th grade
You probably think that i'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, i just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
As i fall down a cement flight of steps (ahhhh)
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

{just let it go}
People say that i'm a bad influence

My basic disk will make you take a razor into your wrist
Make you satanistic
Make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains
Are rippin' out your skull so bad
And sew you back and be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "role model," i don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and hailey jade is shady's business
And shady's just an alias i made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when gil was payin me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You may be gettin' a bigger attitude than maybe kim's got
And the shit's almost got the same fate that grady's bitch got
I know that "just the two of us" would make you hate me this much
And just the two of us
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life
It's just words on a mic.
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a show business pig
But the funny shit is that i still go with the bitch

{just let it go}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin' to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol

We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one


I'm a bad mother-, shout your mouth
Insanity, DVD, how I stretch 'em out
What the stress about? INS best out
Fact, you knew that before he left the house
Fresh at the produce section
Gaze at my shine like a showroom necklace
Death wish, stepping in, declaration
I'm checking niggas like test questions


Across 110th now, 
Camera hawk hawks the sidewalk
When they get to flexing muscle niggas bust you
Hustlers do you, gave you your first toolie
Cutting out of school to pump your first loose leaf
Think graduate to wait, take it out of state, duct tape
Anything of pulse and heroin
Emcees frozen, cuban links golden
Everywhere I'm opening it up, they kill it raw
Math here, I got 'em keep coming back for more


Yo, man, I'm so turned up, all the marijuana burned up
Y'all don't want the drama, word up
The Wu first up, the game is the world versus us
Y'all was good 'til the world heard us
Y'all ain't want them Clan birds up
Y'all done want your man served up
That'll get the fans worked up
Homie really wanna play, stir it up
I'mma catch me a wave, surfs up
Gliding on the track like this, make me wanna act like this
Make me wanna smack that trick
Make a killer really wanna yap that kid
If he opens up his yap that's it




Mass of minerals in a glass house
Playing the 4th neutrinos will blast out
Letting out verbal thunder bolts
Until the world attract old and younger folks
Charge with the vitality of magnetism
In large reality with massive rhythm
The manual without technical part
From the beginning give off an electrical spark


I respect you if you respect me
Everything's for real, WTC
No fake ass shit, don't front the Remy
Break bread, never have pockets empty
Let's get it, flip it up then we can spend it
The money train, killer bees on your brain
W's everywhere, one on your chain
Homeboys for life, please don't change
You can hide at my house, it ain't no thing
If you see the pigs, don't say jack
Call me original, don't say cap
I'm on the low, might be at the murder
Holding off the place y'all cats never heard of
Yeah, chicks wanna peep me out
Nasty ass, want me to pee in their mouth
But now I'm out, about to link with stinks




Bang a few notes up top, we call it beast mode
Forget the street codes, show you like a deep throat
It gets rougher, you struggle from the heat stroke
Blast barrels, embrace my leaf smoke
 radio for back up
Polish your act up, nigga need a back up
Syrup in my cup, no cut, straight up
UG's in the court, never miss a lay up


When the emcees came to live out their names
Some rode the bus, some rode the train
Some motherfuckers wish they never came
When they met the nine swordsmen of Wu-Tang
Nine Maseratis pulls up to this party hard
Body, the party is still, but God body
It's out of shape models coming through with those bottles
End up with these, please, four eyes follow
Pass me a bucket of ice, that's nice
Hit with the rocker, what you say proper
I drink with the copper, show up with a chopper
Stop her, she wanna have a ménage à trois
I can tell by the bra 
Do you wish or wish upon a star?
Do you wish or wish upon a star?




I said tell me whats really going on
Drizzy back up in this thing Im ready, whats happenin?
Gone for surgery but now Im back again

World Series attitude, champagne bottle life

I will have a model wife your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake you got em right?) Yeah I got em Bun

That's the shit I'm talking about though
Like you changed up
You don't even fucking link nobody no more
You just dash me away like a cyattie
Yo, you cheesed me dog

Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it’s dark out 
To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss ya
Shit’ll come back around and get ya
Crazy like all my niggas
Crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the BAR exam
I drove in the snow for you
You probably don’t remember half the shit a nigga did for you

Ya, you ain’t really fuck with me way back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
How bout now?
Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?

Always been daddy’s little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain’t even say thank you
I had no money
Left from back when I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like “who’s this?”
I be like “me, girl.”
You be like “oh word, true shit?”
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel I have it like that
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I’m not even Christian I still went to church that year
Guess, I just had to pretend that year
I ain’t even see my friends that year
Places that I should’ve been

You ain’t really fuck with me way back then
But how bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?

You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl

Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?


Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down


Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre
The concept of school seems so securrre
Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well




Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe




I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering "where the ballas' at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it



10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone till November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house takin' no calls
I done hit the stride, got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the wri-wri-wri-wri




Cloud nine, Kendrick Lamar, uh
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I started questioning God, what is my purpose?
He say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up man, I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again


What am I gonna do? Gotta have faith
Life is too much, understood? Where is your faith?
Oh, faaaaaaaith...
All you need is the size of a mustard seed


Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't bout shit, that nigga ain't bout shit
Spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature
and maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice
that said the Devil is a lie, make a better choice
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
with them crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her section 8
Then lost her faith again




Kendrick, I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
This about how faith works, yeah, murk it...
I had dreams of holding a nine-milla to raise Killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas ensue
The rat's lurking, vulture's circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
to make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach cloud nine, that's what my niggas bout
But it never rain in California 'less them pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Ray Charles voice




This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering is there really a God?
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
But whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
and wonder why I ain't never caught that feeling before
Maybe they know him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know is that he's real and he lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because he's testing your faith again

I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
than die and find out there really is, think about it 

All aboard, okay, next stop, my basement… ha ha
I'll meet you down there

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Haters getting mad, they done had enough of shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touche me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's a no-no who even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I ought to just be honest but

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert, and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad, when I call them both faggots
It's all these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the weiner schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
Body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him
Homie, I'm the sheisse, pass Doctor Dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussys queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A even got a bidet
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator 



It's not me and you
It's not me it's you
Your reckless and you know it
They don't love you like I do
Say you're moving over, like guess that's just the motion

I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

I don't have a fuck to give
I been moving state to state
In my leather and my Tims
Like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chubb
That's my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
That's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling
'Cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone

But, I guess that's just the motion
And your phone doesn't ring when they got everything
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

Yeah,
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
'Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her
And she know it
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help

But, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh) 

I grew up, a fuckin' screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need somethin' newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I won't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I, could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
Cause I'm tryna stay alive,
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet tryna dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? Aye who am I? (Yeah)

Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better dawg I can't lie
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to sooth your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

I always did shit the hard way, my niggas *** slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was broadway, Times Square
Kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chubacca
Whispers that he got it for the low low
Sell a, dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain, took her whip
The appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front door
His mama at home, she still let em' hit the blunt though
I told her hello and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash, and just asked
"What a nigga gotta do to get that? Put me on"
He just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga you know how you sound right now?
You won't my mans, I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me, when I look up to you
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't never want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show ol' girl what she missing
The illest nigga alive
Aye who am I?

Things change, rearrange and so do I (Aye who am I?)
It ain't always for the better dawg I can't lie (Aye who am I?)
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to sooth your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

I never felt better

(uhh, Young Money, Yea)

:

One thing bout music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that sh*t that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, its just game
Its just what comes with the fame, and Im ready for that, Im just sayin
But I really cant complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin Ima quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
Im really too young to be feelin this old
Its about time you admit it, who you kiddin, man?
Man, nobodys never done it like I did it (Ugh)

Intro] 
Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging 

 
I'm withholding my anger 
Though I'd like to be the strangler 
Of this punkass little pussy's puny neck 
It's my right to insist 
That he acknowledge my existence 
But he just displays complete lack of respect 
That's what he says to himself 
As he uses magazines to trash me 
As he sits with both feet up at his desk 
Smokes a bag of his weed 
And starts imagining things 
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed 
And in his jealousy and envy 
It just whirls him in a frenzy 
As he turns on MTV and sees my face 
He don't exist in this world 
So he just twists and he twirls 
Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a race 
And it's destroying him slowly 
Cuz he does not even know me 
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes 
So he just tortures himself 
He has no fortune and wealth 
So he extorts someone else to get his dough 
And now he's acting like a bully 
So he tries to push and pull me 
But he knows that he can't pull me so he's mad 
He has no choice but to scream 
And raise his voice up at me 
Cuz it annoys him to see that I ain't scared 

 
You aint no motherfucking (bully) 
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking (bully) 
I won't allow it, aint no coward to no (bully) 
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully) 
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...) 

And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...) 

 
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies 
No more unfortunately 
There's so many motherfuckers that just are 
They just keep pounding at me 
Now that I'm down with 50 
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja  
But his ass is such a puppet 
Irv could stick his whole hand up it 
And just make him say what he wants him to say 
But shook-ass Irv's on a string 
And Irv's so nervous that he 
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay 
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough 
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf 
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down 
But our building's made out of bricks 
So you ain't taking out shit 
I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown 
So now you try to pull a race car 
And it backfires in your face hard 
Cuz you know we don't play that black and white shit 
Plus this guy that you fucked 
When you was ecstasied up 
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch 

 
You must be taking to much (E...) 

 
Now what bothers me the most 
About hip-hop is we so close 
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac 
We just lost Jam Master J 
Big L got blasted away 
Plus we lost Bugs, Slayed Son, and Freaky Ta 
It's like a never-ending cycle 
That just seems to come full circle 
Everyone's gotta be so fucking hard 
I'm not excluding myself 
Cuz I been stupid as well 
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart 
But as we grow as men 
We learn to let shit go, but then again 
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand 
We all got reps to uphold 
When someone steps on our toes 
It's no exception, it goes for every man 
But if Irv really gave a fuck 
About Ja like he claims he does 
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs 
But he just keeps feeding him pills 
So if that E doesn't kill him 
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed 
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight 
If the situation escalates 
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game 
And if I get killed for this rap 
I got a million in cash 
That says I will get you back in Halie's name 

 
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...) 

 
Get at me, dawg 
Holla

I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks
Hit me when you done your shift
Wooh, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what?
I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky
I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me
Someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-the-strippin-shit"
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me
I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect
She's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog

Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift
I need some company
I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company

I dont know I just want it better for my kids 
And I aint sayin we was from the projects 
But everytime I wanna layaway or deposit 
My dad'll say when you see clothes, close your eyelids 
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son 
In the movie I aint talkin' bout the rich ones 
Cuz every summer 
He'll get some brand new harebrain scheme to get rich from 
And I dont know what he did for dough 
But he'll send me back to school with a new wardrobe 
and ay, ay, ay ,ay

Drop gems like i droped out of PE 
They used to feel invisible 
Now they now they invincible

Only over my dead body...

Slave to the p-ssy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yea
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again 
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine 
And I be hearing sh*t you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yea
It's been that way from the beginning I just been playing, I aint even notice that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright


I know, I know that you love me baby
The time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body


You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And f-ck you to the niggas that thinks it's there time, yea
Don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever gave you a star boy
Or you wanna be a mother fuckin' funny guy
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart boy
Yea, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel now more than ever
My city love me like I'm Mac Dre in The Bay
Second Album I'm pack paving away
The backpackers are back on the band wagon like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby's mom last night
We took a picture Last night
I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And lost everything that I came with
Yea, feel like I've been here before
I still got 10 years to go, ha
And this is the only sound you should fear
And these kids where crowns over here & everything is alright...





Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I die today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucka for women licking their lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless
I saw but never noticed that a college point is right to
'Be all that you can be' posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote
But know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'd find it
And knew one day that you'd come back and rewind this, singing...



I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better tonight)
If you ain’t fucking with that
I don’t care (yeah, yeah, yeah)



Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff
I got a life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you: "You the only reason why I don't flip and go insane"
My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change
No, just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows them
Don't you ever go expose them
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself
I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's the tutor for me
Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except




I said tell me whats really going on
Drizzy back up in this thing I’m ready, whats happening
gon for surgery but now I’m back again
I’m bout my paper like a muthf-cking scratch and win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife your b-tch is as hot as ice
every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake you got em right)
Yeah I got em Bun
I love myself because I swear their life is just not as fun
Neks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ’s got my credit cards and a lot of ones
yeah, I’m in the city of the purple sprite
someone tell Maliah I’m on fire she should work tonight
call her King of Diamonds and tell China it’d be worth the flight
I’ll be at my table stacking dollar’s to the perfect height
work something twirk something basis
she just tryna make it so she right here gettin naked
I don’t judge her, I don’t judge her
but I could never love her cause to her I’m just a rapper
and soon she’ll have met another
thats why me and lil jazz bout to spaz can you keep up
I’m just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up
yeah bills everywhere, trill everything
and Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj
I told her I’d admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we f-cking did it
and girl I’m f-cking serious I’m with it if you with it
cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
uh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
like I catch em stealing flows cause I swear I never loaned it
and Life aint a rehearsal the camera’s always rollin’
so come and get a portion of this money that we be blowin’
cause it’s on…


Yeah girl it’s on
you know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope you miss me a little when I’m gone
yeah I just hope you miss me a little when I’m gone
and you just tell me what you down for
anything you down for
I know things have changed
Know I used to be around more
but you should miss a little when I’m gone
I just hope you miss me a little when your gone


Oooh sh-t,
muthaf-cker God Damn
kicking b-tches out the Condo like pam

bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don’t piss the ground off
Man I swear my b-tches do it till they suck the brown off
erghhhh, thats nasty
yes I am Weezy but I aint asthmatic
James Bond cologne, hunny i put on

voice baritone haters carry on
beat the p-ssy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money’s Jerry Sloan
I turn every stone
“When she masturbate to me, that’s how she learn every song
to women I condone better write me when I’m gone
no I’m not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
uhh, I’m a love machine
and I wont work for nobody but you
it’s only me and her because the Bugatti coupe
its blood gang slam but I party with Snoop
I aint lying I shoot

and when Im in the booth, sh-t the lion is loose
man I got so many styles I am a group
Damn, I’ll be gone till November
f-ck it I aint trippin, I know Drizzy gon’ kill em’
I’m sticking to the script like lint on denim
I’mma say it if the rules aint bent don’t bend em’
real n-gga talking

Weezy F Baby and the F is for Front do’
Cause that’s where I bring it,
soo wu if you bang it, mothaf-cka




I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25 sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?


One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt?
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

 


It’s like I'm in the dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won’t work
All it takes is one song on the radio you’re right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burned, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don’t suppose an explanation I’m owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I’d never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
'bout to go through’s tougher than anything I have suffered
Can’t think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"


I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy


And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pain of resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you?
The cause to my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone




I've been driving around your side of the town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders before hand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost half of a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back as they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it we are in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by Eminem
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
(Help, police!!)
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, hope you can swim good!
Now say you hate homos again!


I also represent anyone normally seen on the end of these jokes of a beat
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Backs to the wall, I’m stacking up all them odds, toilets cock
Yeah ‘cause I’m talking a lot of shit but I’m backing it all up
But in my head there’s a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I’m the ringing in your ears
I’m the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I’m your time that’s almost up that you haven’t acknowledged
Grab for some water but I’m that pill that’s too jagged to swallow
I’m the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult there
With the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mather’s the rapper’s persona’s have a facade and 
Matthew and Stan’s just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it’s gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them,
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don’t stop after they call you
The biggest laughing stock of rap who can’t call it quits
But it’s time to walk away
I’m ever guilt trip the baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time, I’m back
Before it fades into black and it’s all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers’ left off

I'm not sure anymore (more) (more) who is knocking at my door (door) (door)
all the friends that I know their but so sorry and sure

CHORUS
I don't wanna say goodbye to you so I'll just say goodnight to you
My people wonder why to you I'm just gonna say goodnight

VERSE 1
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could re-live it
Me and my grand parents on a field trip
and I'm a little kid trying to test the exhibits but 
In a faithful I get to get a hold of that
Men I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I would know the laugh
Men, I wouldn't let a moment pass
What would it mean when you dream that you're falling
What would it mean when you dream that you're balling
What would it mean when you never dream at all and u don't really know
but you can't recall them
It's all a fight to get a chance to say hi to 
people you never got the chance to say hi to
Maybe you could put them up out of your dream into real life if you try to
So close (so close) So far (so far) so far (so far) no cigar (no cigar)
you can't dwell on the past all we got is today so Ima live like there is no tomorrow

CHORUS

VERSE 2
If I promp my uncle live through you 
dream beautiful and unusual
wake up like every day new to you
stay true to you a whole musical
my uncle live through you
dream beautiful and unusual
wake up like every day new to you
stay true to you a whole musical

CHORUS

I'm not sure anymore (more) (more) who is knocking at my door (door) (door)
all the friends that I know their but are so sorry and sure


I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdose on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it,(aye) please don't do it,(aye) cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,


Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind.
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize it happened over time
She says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you suppose to do
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions.
You know the game even got it like that.
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that.
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind (mind, mind, mind)
Tell em' I apologize it happened over time (time, time, time)
They know


If a miracle, could save us from
The travesty, that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


The whole world trippin', listen it's still a cold world
The other day I had to bury my homegirl
Wrong place, caught one in her face
Plus her man's on the run and couldn't come to the wake
For Heaven's sake, you pray God open the gate
In this modern day Sodom, that's their only escape
10 year olds are cold, no, they don't hesitate
2 up a G pack, he chose the whole 8
Catch a 5 to 10 sellin' 5's and 10's
And the police informer was your childhood friend
In the real world, gotta hustle for your dream
Extend your clips, fit the muzzle with the beam
For the love of cream, it's nothin' but routine
Swing on the judge, take a couple for the team
He's the young Capone, he grew up in a drug home
Stranded on the Ave with a blunt and his gun shown




Alive, seen things from the Godfather saga
A Martin Scorsese classic and I'm the author
Drama at the opera, crime story novel
Tuxedo suit and silencer on the nozzle
Meeting place scheduled at the Broadway musical
Bravo, we arrive in bulletproof limo
Shotgun, the underboss of our main source
Of interest, the black widow cocaine empress
A princess rich from her family's inheritance
Now let's talk business, begin by addressin' the bricks
That was missin' in the last shipment
At first, everything nice, everything routine
Jocks lining up the food, we blessed him with the cream
But on this day he wasn't ready and my God sense keen
I noticed that his normal firm handshake shook
It wasn't steady when he squeezed




He went from prince to a king out of a life of rubbish
Wearin' tailor-made suits, Sky Dwellers and clusters
To perfection, rags to riches, the evil's done influenced
That pushed him off the edge, they said the greed made him do it
You're my right hand, damn, he fucked the trust up
It's ruined, niggas caught him slidin' on his belly
I'm grippin' on my hammer with the silencer twisted
Contemplatin' murder now, I'm 'bout to swerve on my biscuit
But it's my man at the same time, I don't wanna do him
He violated, broke a major code, bar what you stealin' now
It's over, in the falls of Niagara, he was soakin'
With a shell case stuck in his head, they found him floatin'




Allah let me lay in your arms
Hold me like a newborn, sing to me the most sweetest song
The exalted, the most benevolent
The knower of all, keep me safe 'till I return back to your residence
This Earth, my place of birth
As time went through the ages it got worse
Sicknesses, beheadings in Syria
Ebola's killin' my people, it's gettin' scarier
Most foods ain't even real, the chip is here
Deadly fluids bein' released, contracted through air
Dear God, it's been a minute since I cried out
Since mama died, I never wild out
We need help like the phone's 'bout to die out
Can you hear me? Can you hear me now?
We need a miracle
Destroy the FDA for holdin' back cures so they can get paid




Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Yeah
Too late
I cant keep chasing em
Taking my life like that
Caught in a change
25 to life


I dont think she understands the sacrifices that I made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I wouldve stayed
But ive already wasted over half of my life I wouldve laid
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
Imma take control of this relationship
Command it, and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while ive stayed
Faithfull all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I aint heard you yet
Not even once say you apreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so dont hold your fucking breath
You know what youve done no need to go in depth
I told you, youd be sorry if I fucking left
Id laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny aint it, you neglected me
Did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but its,


Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life


I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that aint good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Till I snap
Dont think im loyal
All I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Dont I give you enough of my time
You dont think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why im married to you still man I dont know
But tonight im serving you with papers
Im divoricing you
Go marry someone else and make em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat em like you dont need them and they aint worthy of you
Feed em the same shit that you made me eat
Im moving on forget you oh,
Now im special, I aint felt special when I was with you
All I ever felt was dissed
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
Its ridiculus
And still I stick with this
Im sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Your addicive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away from
Im addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
Im drawn to this, so I guess imma mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time imma
Aint changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abiss
You screaming as I walk out that ill be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop
Im leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And its just


Too late for the other side
Caught in a change
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a change
25 to life
Too late
Caught in a change
25 to life

Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That being known let me know
Let me

Seems like street lights glowing
Happen to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fares
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the streetlights glowing
Happen to be
Just like moments passing
In front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fare
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

In the streets... In the streets
I'm just not there
In the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

Seems like street lights glowing
Happen to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fares
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the streetlights glowing
Happen to be
Just like moments passing
In front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fare
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the streetlights glowing
Happen to be
Just like moments passing
In front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fare
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

In the streets... In the streets
I'm just not there
In the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit ain’t my fault, girl cause I'm lonely

Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody’s house that you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it, I’m not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae

This shit ain’t my fault

You know a lotta girls be...thinking my songs about them, but
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...


Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say you da fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate,
Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the matt and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

Cause,



Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffin theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 
I say...
You da fuckin' best 
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had 

Uhh, ah yea
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money
You know who you are, I got ya

I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

You understand me?
Showtime, headlines
Big time, sunshine, tote nines
Bust mines, flatline, hard grind
High life, stay fly as jet time
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga
Stunt nigga
I might just bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it


No matter what the weather, we be getting our cheddar
So we can have a better tomorrow
Oh, money, cars, superstars, getting ours, working hard
For a better tomorrow


Coach, put me in the game
I'm for real, other peoples tryna to put me in them chains
Whatever the topic, let's put it in the frame
We can even load it and cock it and put it in they brains
I'm saying, some rappers do it for a chain
Kill yourself, I know killers that'll do it for some change
These veterans is slipping, they ain't doing it the same
I don't slip, set a pick and put a shooter in your lane
Precise, 'bout shoot them at the range
But I ain't tryna shoot it with you rappers, I'll just shoot it at your dame
Y'all never should have threw me in the game
Found a new word for weed, that was so mean
I threw it in my name


My soul laid out on the block like arms spraying
The law hating, warring like Blacks and Caucasians
God versus Satan, I'm laying in the dark
With the Mossberg, waiting, letting off first basing
Slim from the cotton club washing a scrub
Deuce high when he cruise by, spotting his love
Hold the mic like a .38 muzzle to snub
This flow, call it OJ blood on the glove
Above rap, capital G's speak on the facts
Please believe that, meaning that I keep it a stack
He's back, he a beast on the track
The only time that I go soft is probably with your freak in the sack
Feel the bass make sure he shake, murder verse, first forty-eight
Manslaughter, nearly caught a case
I crack heads more than base
Stack bread when I orchestrate, that said y'all the base




I seen niggas sniff coke through a crazy straw
Come out they shirts sweating bullets with the Bobby Brown jaw
Dry mouth, grinding back and forth plus he's steaming a Newport
We all holdin' the torch
Few staircase murders, some burners don't blam right
Guns that kicked around the wall you better stand tight
Full of X, AK's, whilin' in lobbys, bulletproof PJ's
Fuck around and get spunned like the DJ
CSI traumatized by viewing the instant replay
Spongebob niggas get scars nigga
I'm off style in any section of the hood I'll pull your car nigga




See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat

See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat



Ay yo, I used to be so narcissistic, park the whip and spark the biscuits
Spit hollow tipped shells at the Narcs with quickness
Live to tell the tale, cause only God's my witness
Been a long time, change gonna come son, I'm optimistic
I hold the steel like Ron O'Neal
Super fly, do or die, killer hill, Brownsville
Never win, never will, yes I can, yes I will
Put a dot upon your knot then I drill through your grill
Like a dentist, my apprentice speaks with a vengeance
Demented scientists counting bodies in the trenches
That's judges off the benches, got inches for y'all wenches
We plant those hot seeds then drove in cold winters



I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe

Look inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt and never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don’t know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


I’m trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I’m looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I’ll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock


I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe


You ain’t heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don’t you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3′s in the air I can see you are – in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I’ll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it’s alive
My new year’s resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say – Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe

(with Big Sean, Jay-Z)


What of the dollar you murdered for
Is that the one fighting for your soul
Or your brother’s the one that you’re running from
But if you got money, fuck it, because I want some


Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain’t nobody freshin’ than my muthafuckin’
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don’t do it like my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the


I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me like I’m coming out the driveway
It’s grande, from Friday, to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day
She tryna get me that poo tang
I might let my crew bang
My crew deeper than Wu Tang
I’m rolling with (Huh) fuck I’m saying?
Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr!
I’m pullin’ up in that Bruce Wanye
But I’m the fuckin’ villian, man, they kneelin when I walkin in the building
Freaky women I be feelin’ from the bank accounts I’m fillin’
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D that’s killin’ everything that he see




Yeah am talking Ye’, yeah am talking Rih’, yeah I’m talking Bey, nigga I’m talking me
Yeah I’m talking bossy, I ain’t talking Kelis
You’re money too short, you can’t be talking to me
Yeah I’m talking LeBron, we balling our family tree
G.O.O.D Music drug dealing drug cousin, ain’t nothing fuckin’ with we
Turn that 62 to 125, 125, to a 250, 250 to a half a milli, ain’t nothin’ nobody can do with me
Now who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or jefe
Translation, I’m the shit. Least that what my neck say, least that what my check say
Lost my homie for a decade, nigga down for like 12 years, ain’t hug his son since the second grade
He never told, who we gonna tell, we top of the totem pole
It’s the dream team meets the supreme team, and all our eyes green and only means one thing
You ain’t fuckin’ with my clique


Break records of Louie
Ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival the unamerican idols
When niggas did in Paris got em hanging off the Eiffel
Yeah I’m talking business
We talking CIA
I’m talking George Tenet
I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach
Think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money don’t spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig’nant
I know Spike Lee gon kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits
Them gold master p ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I’m looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
That’s Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn’t really drunk he just had a few brews
Pass the refreshment a cool cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew present
Steve-O swerve homie, watch out for the waves
I’m way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditated the home in Pompay
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I’m in Vegas they screaming like he’s Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real got me feelin’ Isrealian
Like Bar Refaeli Gisele, no thats Brazilian
Went through deep depression when my momma passed
Suicide what kind of talk is that
But I’ve been talking to God for so long
That I have you look in my life I guess he talking back
Fuckin’ with my clique 

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?

Cause if we ever got together
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever
And well that ain't my thing cause I
I ain't even got my own
And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
And I thought about the things we did
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
I don't wanna wait forever

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

Hello, hello?
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Everything's so sad when you look back

On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick don't it
Reflection bring regrets don't it
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end

It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good

It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen, you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soul mate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you

She said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

These days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?


Yeah Grandmama
Told you I won't let you down
Told you I won't let this rap game change me, right?


When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
Oh no you'll neva let me down,
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)


Yo, yo first I snatched the street then I snatched the charts,
First had they ear now I hav they're heart,
Rappers came and went,
I've been hear from the start,
Seen them put it together
Watch them take it apart,
See the Rovers roll up wit ribbons
I've seen them re-poed, re-sold and re-driven
So when I reload, he holds #1 position
When u hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin
It's plain to see
Nigga's can't f*** wit me
Cuz ima be that nigga fo life
This is not an image
This is God given
This is hard liven
Mixed wit crystal sipping
It's the most consistent
Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy




I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit that seat where white folks ain't wanna us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
With that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music
And I just don't be feeling it
Racism still alive they just be concealing it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptised at least 3 or 4 times
But in the land where nigga's praise
Yukons and getting paid
It gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than do-rags to get your waves
Noting sadder than that day my girl father past away
So I promised to Mr Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And u know I gotta thank u for they way that she was brought up
And I know that u were smiling when u see that car I bought her
And u sent tears from heaven when u seen my car get balled up
But I can't complaint what the accident did to my Left Eye
Cuz look what a accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah and now romeo must die
I know a got angels watching me from the other side




We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this
That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental
Vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that is not what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte
I'm tryina give us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you, my many inspirations
When I say I can't, let you or self down
If I were of the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life in my grip
I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out




Who else you know been hot this long,
(Oh Ya, you know we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong,
(The ROC is in the building)
Built the ROC from a pebble, pedalled rock before I met you,
Pedalled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special,
Let you tell that man I'm falling,
Well somebody must've caught him,
Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em,
Number one albums, what I got like four of dem,
More of dem on the way,
The Eight Wonder on the way,
Clear the way, I'm here to stay,
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that, this and Jay,
Dissin' Jay 'ill get you mased,
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious,
Six Hail Maries, please Father forgive us,
Young, the Archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas,
The way y'all all follow Jigga,
Hov's a living legend and I tell you why,
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov still alive.


"Morning, Marshall."
"Morning, doc."
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
"Anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. 
Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"
"Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back"
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."
"Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and 
it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, 
we know you're a busy person."
"But I thought variety was the most important thing?"
"So what else are you thinking?"
"Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, 
and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."
"Steps?"
"Yeah, steps."
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?
"Well, twelve."
"Christ, I don't even know them all."
"Really?"
"Anything else?"
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, 
what do I do if I find myself in a situation where 
maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I 
get tempted to?"
"Take a drink."
"What?"
"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."
"Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink 
I already know what that's gonna lead me to."
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
"Man, what the fuck!?"
"Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? 
Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. 
We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall...? Marshall!?
"No, no, no, no, NO!"

i pray you will
when i grab your neck i touch your soul
take off your cool then lose control
hey hey hey hey don't say you will you will you will
hey hey hey hey don't say you will if you will i pray you will
i wish this song would really come true
i admit i still fantasize about you, about you
hey hey hey hey don't say you will, you will, you will
hey hey hey hey please say you will for real, i pray you will

Feelings 
The emotional side of a man, woman or a child's character 
A response or tendency to respond 
A belief, which can be vague, illogical, but emotionally irrational 

I never gave a f

{verse 1}
all niqht i've, been starin'
can you tell i want you ?
can't be too, wide open
but there's nothin, i won't do
ohhh... just want  you to know

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

{verse 2}
I wish i... wasn't famous
I wish i... was still in school
So that i can have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you crazy

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

Hollywood Cole
Go
Ay Hollywood
Hollywood Cole
Go

You wanna know just where I'm at
Well let me tell you 'bout it
I put my city on the map
But let me tell you 'bout it
They tryna say I can't come back
Ay let me tell you 'bout it
Man fuck them nigga I come back
Ay let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it
Hands up, everybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like "man that's what everybody say"
Go and pop the trunk and everybody dead
Everybody scared of the nigga
Aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter
Never bitter
Niggas is faker than anime
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, woah
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake
Fuck good nigga we demand great
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait
The best kept secret
Even hoes try and keep it and I leak the damn tape
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Even secret service couldn't keep the man safe

I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

Get off my dick, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick nigga)
Get off my dick, bitch, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick, bitch, woah

Man fuck them niggas I come home and I don't tell nobody
They gettin' temporary dough and I don't tell nobody
Lord will you tell me if I changed, I won't tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine, and I won't tell nobody
This is the part that the thugs skip
Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through
(The break up)
Get to know somebedy and you learn a lot about 'em
When we long for you, start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breath without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em
It's called love
Niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
No more, no more
It's called love
Niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
(Nigga I don't sing about this shit no more)
But there a nigga in the club singing

I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

Get off my dick
But every nigga in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
Got all the bitches in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
And all they mamas let their kids sing it
Sing this song yeah
The baby mamas and the mistresses
Singing this song yeah
Song yeah, song song yeah

(The make up)
This shit is retarded
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless
That's a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Ariel Heights
Here's a scenario
Young Cole pockets is fat like little Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah fuck nigga I'm very sure
Fuck the rest I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home I'm the best in the South
When I'm in LA I'm the best in the West
You can test, you can test, I'mma stretch niggas out
Oooh I'mma stretch niggas out
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out
This shit for everbody on my testicle
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, ho 

And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags!
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

She find pictures in my email
I sent this girl a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit

And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

And I always find

(Pusha T)

24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha?
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, they wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes wit' a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!

(Kanye)

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know it did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me
I'm guessin' you're at an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

And I always find
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left.
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Nights over goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's dumb enough out there I blind fold her,
She still comes back to my crib, Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But i wont buy her a soda Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of fritos I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would i buy you a gay ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Man TIP told me on this hoe tip
Best tip I could give you to hip you
Never let these traits trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, shit
Dig you a hole
Take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, its you, but fuck it TIP, it's cool
I'm chillin like a Villain
Like the penguin in it's fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
before I tie a fucking knot I'd tie you in one bitch
you think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger although a nickle might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
there's a bombshell, scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was some motherfucking stud
Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way fo shizzle
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slot checks stob bizzle
So fuck scissors these checkers are bust like a blood blister


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote


Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP
And each one thinks "Say this shit"
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, put a sticky note to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gonna tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote 

 Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

 Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see


Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right 
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
We elevated to new heights premeditated 
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate 
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance 
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop 
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know


So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

 Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see


So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack 


So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become

I got a bone to pick 
I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again 
(Aye aye nigga whats happenin' nigga, K Dot back in the hood nigga) 
I'm mad (He mad), but I ain't stressin' 
True friends, one question 

Bitch where you when I was walkin'? 
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta 
Black man taking no losses 
Bitch where you when I was walkin'? 
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him 

When you got the yams (What's the yams?) 
The yam is the power that be 
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street 
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can) 
I can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer 
What the fuck happened? 
(Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell 
But most of you share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell 
(A two man cell) 
Something's in the water (Something's in the water) 
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller 

When you got the yams (What's the yams?) 
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor 
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires 
24/7, 365 days times two 
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage 
Just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say... 

You goat mouth mammy fucker 
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves 
Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help 
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail 
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left 
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton" 
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest 
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too 
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' woo woo 
Ah yeah fuck the judge 
I made it past 25 and there I was 
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him 
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina 
Screamin' "Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok?" 
Limo tinted with the gold plates 
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast 
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfucking king 

(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk) 
We want the funk 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
(Do you want the funk?) 
We want the funk 
(Do you want the funk?) 
We want the funk 
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) 
We want the funk 
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence


I’m going through changes
I’m going through changes


Lately I really, feel like I’m rolling for like Philly,
I feel like I’m losing control of myself,
I sincerely apologize if all that I sound like, is I’m complaining,
But life keeps on complicating, an’ I’m debating,
On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls,
Can see I’m grievin’, I try and hide it,
But I can’t, why do I act like I’m all high and mighty,
When inside, I’m dying, I am finally realizing I need help.
I can’t do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I’ve been having ups and downs,
Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying,
Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here.
I’m hatin’ my reflection, I walk around the house tryin’ to fight mirrors,
I can’t stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie,
I’m afraid if I close my eyes I might see her,
Shit…




I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin’ at noon,
Yeah dad’s in a bad mood, he’s always snappin’ at you.
Marshall what happened at you, you can’t stop with these pills,
And you’ve fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughin’ at you.
It become a problem you’re too pussy to tackle, get up,
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled.
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed,
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust,
Nah, it ain’t like Doody to do that,
He wouldn’t fuckin’ shoot at, no-body, he fights first,
But dwellin’ on it only makes the night worse,
Now I’m poppin Vic’s, perks and Methadone pills.
Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it,
Fuckin’ drug dealers hang around me like “yes man”,
And they gon’ do whatever I says when, I says it,
It’s in their best interest to protect their investment.
And I just lost my fuckin’ best friend, so fuck it, I guess then…



Don’t know what I’m gonna do,
but I just keep on going through changes


My friends can’t understand this new me,
That’s understandable man, but think how bananas you’d be,
You’d be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.
And everybody’s lookin’ at you, what you want me to do,
I’m startin’ to live like a recluse and the truth is,
Fame startin’ to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low.
I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin’ the same damn DVD,
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive.
And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin’ pills’ll make me feel alright.
And if I’m still awake in the middle of the night,
I just take a couple more, yeah you’re motherfuckin’ right,
I ain’t slowin’ down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, dole em out,
Daddy, don’t you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground.
Fuck, don’t I know the sound of that voice,
Yeah baby hold me down.




Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow I’m pullin’ through.
Swear when I come back I’ma be bulletproof.
I’ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few,
Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth.
Shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?
I think about the things I would never got to say to you,
I’d never get to make it right, so here’s what I came to do.
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too,
I still love your mother, that’ll never change,
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together.
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it,
But I swear on everything, I’d do anything for her on anyday.
There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains,
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn’t any pain.
But I can’t pretend there ain’t, I ain’t placin’ any blame,
I ain’t pointin’ fingers, heaven knows I never been a saint.
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history,
But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say,
I miss you self consciously, wish it didn’t end this way.
But I just had to get away, don’t know why,
I don’t know what else to say, I guess I’m…



Cause sometimes you feel tired, Feel weak
And when you feel weak
You feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
You gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that sh*t out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And be a quitter
No matter how bad you just wanna fall flat on your face

Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps as long as you feel 'em
To the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
Your coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a f*ck.


Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this sh*t till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out
I'ma rip this sh*t till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when your real
and you spit and people are feeling your sh*t.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much sh*t as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end.
Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this sh*t that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outcast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the sh*t does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people got a f*cking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you’ve got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.



Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
what is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And its absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.



Until the roof
The roof comes off
Until my legs
give out from underneath me

I will not fall,
I will stand tall,
Feels like no one could beat me.

I want you to understand something
that when I come up in this b-tch I want the fans jumping,
I want the fist pumping in the air,
I dont look like a millionnaire,
but I feel like a million bucks,
ladies wont ya fill your cups,
Shadys come to fill ya up,
if your a D or a C cup
you can even be a B
its just me and DRE
youll be in the ER well be strapped with so much TNT,
we may blow no not even CPR from the EMT
could help you to resuscitate
you busters must be flustered wait
you cant cut the mustard, whats your problem cant you bust a grape,
whats my name, shady came and just crushed the game,
its really not even fair to them,
cos they pale in comparisons
so much they might aswell wear a skin,
dont you just wish you could share his pen
cos this sh-ts getting embarrassing,
the fog is stinking the air is thin,
cos he wont even let them try to breathe,
da da di di da di dee, he makes it look so easy,
girl you just hit the lottery,


now this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on,
and hell breaks loose,
try to restrain us you cant contain us,
we still gonna make a statement no matter what we do,
everywhere we go it seems were looking for any excuse to just cut loose,
so this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose,


This is when sh-ts hits the fan,
like it just splattered on stan
this is the only moment that matters,
ya homie rolled in with Mathers,
like chaos erupts Ems in back Dres in the front
so do what we say at once this songs like a singer it hunts (?),


It makes em stay in a trance
no choice they have to dance,


Its like the play-off just making sure that we stay in the hunt
take a day off of what man you better lay off the blunts
you must be smoking something
you think I aint smoking nothing stay off my nuts,
now hit the floor baby time to wipe away all the rust,
shake all them cobwebs loose,
loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose,
yeah girl shake that caboose
I dont wanna see you try to make no excuse,
DRE is on the loose,
A Mongoose when its comes to the chronic use,
you know I cant stand to lose,
me and my goons are like animals,
we come through like a pack of wolves,
so we came here to retract the roof,
yeah man aint that the truth,
girl your mans like in the booth
definitely back up in this b-tch,
this is when all hell breaks loose,




Now I know your feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words,
A murderer in the flow, liquid courage im finna blow
as soon as we hit the door power surges head to toe
Im sure to push it as far as words are meant to go,
were in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows,
ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block widcha hoe,
with speakers knocking its 3 0 clock
me and Doc then proceed to drop (?)
and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door,


Yeah so let us in fore we huff and puff and we blow,
we aint bluffin for nothing
well knock the stuffing out ya
revenge is so sweet, move til ya injure ya feet
yeah move or lose it three,
move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably,
pass some of that (?) lil right there,
that would be pretty stupid to me,
born and raised in the CPT,
yeah Los Angeles whos in the streets,
them haters hating on me,
but I refuse to lose any sleep,
keep that deuce deuce in the seat,
Dre fall off thats news to me,




F-ck you, motherf-cker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga you ain't sh-t
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga you ain't sh-t
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be f-ckin' with you anyway, I need a baller ass, boss ass nigga
You'se a off brand ass nigga, everybody know it, your homies know it, everybody f-ckin' know
F-ck you nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the f-ck is really going on?

This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made end's meet, eatin' your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes without a Mercedes Benz and twenty four inch rims, five percent tint, and air conditioning vents
Hell f-ckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullsh-t, matador, matador, had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious, kept me up watchin'
Pornos and poverty, apology? No
Watch you volunteer it it while people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has it's day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter fact it need interest, matter fact it's nine inches
Matter fact see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin', my consensus
Been relentless, f-ck forgiveness, f-ck your feelings
F-ck your sources, all distortion, if you f-ck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
F-ck you think is bullsh-t, porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is deaf, a state of decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I the picked cotton that made you rich
Now my dick ain't free

I'mma get my Uncle Sam to f-ck you up
You ain't no king 

Yeah!
Stat quo
Doc Dre
I representin the A town

The ho's get naked
Soon as the song comes on
The niggas get reckless
It's off the chain

Knockin' crowds off the floor

When I walks through the door
It's him
Tell a friend
But you already know
Act stupid and lose it
Don't fuck with quo

8 doobies to the face
Fuck dat
12 bottles in the case
Nigga, fuck dat
2 pills and a half, wait
Nigga, fuck dat
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist


Man, I swear
My nigga trippin off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him vicodin
Hope to take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of section 8
And you feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are
A loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins
Make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin off
My generation sippin cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition
That the world is bout to end
Who gives a fuck? we never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
A melody and some hoes
Playstation and some drank
Technology bumping Soul
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd, that's product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black
She black too
Purple label on her back
But that dap
Is like when she take it straight to the head
Then she look at me
She got AD-HD




Like woah oh oh woah (x4)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(They always told me ad-hd did it)


And then she started
And then she started
Feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
Beg you pardon
Oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23
Ok then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said where my drink at?
I'mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors
Have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds
Closed the screen, jumbotron
Made it to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it
Then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That ADHD crazy






You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six
Just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, dro, hoes
Whatever you like
You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light


Huh, after all these years, what you said was true
The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang is very dangerous


It's the ODB kid, once again coming through your area
And I'm going to tell you one time, you gon' love this


I had to get the money, said it wasn't a choice
Die Hard's on the bars, Ladies lovin' the voice
Morphine flow, numbing your joints
Bomb a nigga like he number 81 from Detroit
Zombie life, World War Z
Antidote to your virus, your highness, the world on me
Capital G, cool as the dude from Dos Equis
So deadly, I don't make it rain, I snow heavy
Sick lane, Nic Cage how I ride with fire
Forever with bars, sort of like a lifer
With the Son of Anarchy, I be Breaking Bad
Walking Dead, day dreaming of making a band
Dancing With the Stars, Americans Idol me
The Mentalist with the Big Bang Theory


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


The most duplicated, anticipated, validated
Urban legends in the books with the ones who made it
Highly celebrated, everything was work related
Current top 40 got the Wu deep in all their business
20 years Killa Bees, yeah, we hold the pennant
Monumental stance on the cover with my co-defendants
Drop her sentence, in remembrance
Construct these jewels so they can live through my descendants


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one




Picture a nigga on the strip getting rich off the drug shit
Putting other niggas on, teaching ‘em thug shit
Then they want stick 'em up, then they get slugs quick
Hood-type niggas always living that crime life
Jealous-ass grimy niggas seeing the limelight
Slimy old nigga like fucking your man’s wife
Fool shouldn't use the word brother, he man dyke


Yo, I spin my web all across New York
Get it out in all types of ice, there's a sport
One chain, two chain, three chain, four
Niggas mouth's drop like the leaves in the fall
Tone got that WBC
I take off heavy in air ballons and land in the Fiji's
That's my bird and that's my word
You faggots keep fucking around and get curbed


Forms circles like the rings of Saturn
Dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
Then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
A wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
A wild fire engulfing every home
It's history chiseled and carved in every stone
A workshop where skills are learned
Handcrafted and drafted, written works the main concern
Urban center provided with a social structure
And a curious culture full of superconductors
Each stain is part of a scene with
Intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
Spell bounding, marvellous and it's surrounding
Viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
A place where the forgotten art is so powerful
A striking image is something that's so valuable


This one's the blackout! Three-fifty-seven to your mouth!


GZA, this is called Ruckus In B Minor
Rae, all those bad times is behind us
Ghost, put that mask on to remind us
Method Man, let 'em know who's New York's finest




Now I'mma let all you motherfuckers know
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga, I don't give a fuck
Where you be motherfucker!


My lines is like Peruvian coke, go ahead and try one
My recipe is A1 remarkable with my mixture
Rainman mathematician, this city slicker
Finest threads cover my frame, the cloths of royalty
Strive with an army of winners and no pretenders
(*One*) We live free and achieve more
But first we gotta win with no stale mate
The all eye seeing is victorious biz to the sound man


All my trucks, tanks are bulletproof, been the truth
Loot the track, clear the booth, my thought ready, aim, shoot
My knowledge one twenty proof, let's tear the roof off
Let's spray, M-A-S-T-A
King I Love-Love club, pack stadium rock
I hold the mic snug, split a slug
Black ninja, mask and gloves





Drake-Over-Thank me later
(uhh,
Young Money,
Yea)

:
I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last year, who the fuck are yall?
I swear it feels like the last few nights

But I just cant remember it all.

What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh, yeah, thats right, Im doing me

Im living life right now, man

And this what Ima do til its over
Til its over
But its far from over...

1:
Bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are yall thinkin?
Makin sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin
Bout to set it off, set it off in this Bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldnt've drove, tell me how Im gettin home?
You too fine to be layin down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I needs a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the swishers
I did it overnight, it couldnt happen any quicker
Yall know them? Well, fuck it, me either
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make'em a believer
It wouldnt be the first time I done it, throwin hundreds
When I should be throwin ones, bitch, I run it (Ah)

2
One thing bout music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, its just game
Its just what comes with the fame, and Im ready for that, Im just sayin
But I really cant complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinking Ima quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
Im really too young to be feelin this old
Its about time you admit it, who you kiddin, man?
Man, nobodys never done it like I did it (Ugh)

I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last year, who the fuck are yall?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back

(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.)
Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Drawin' a Blank like
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.

Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma do that for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.

()

Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
Imeet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

()

You're everything that I see
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly,

I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost


I’ve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn’t change
And I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? please don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours we both know
We know, they don’t get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste,ah
Pushing me away so I give her space,ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
I’ll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don’t know
Trying to run from that, say you’re done with that
On your face girl, it just don’t show
When you’re ready, just say you’re ready
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
And the party's over, just don’t forget me
We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won’t ever have to worry,
You won’t ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes


Cause if you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost


Yeah
It’s my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can’t deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don’t say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you’re following your heart
Cause your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know, you hate being alone
You ain’t the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin’ to save you
Instead they say,
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true


I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost 


I ain't trying to be no D-boy, I love music, I'm a b-boy
Are you the undercover or the decoy
I'm heavy with the D, Trouble T Roy
A pit with no muzzle about to bust your bubble like a keloid
Too much marijuana got me p-noid
I'm killing instrumentals with that All So Simple Can It Be, boy
Shout to Lil Cease, B.I.G., boy
And Funk Doctor Spock, I mean Redman that's not Leonard Nimoy
88 keys on the keyboard
I'm down to catch wreck, take them first three letters out of record
It's Meth, you heard it through the wire I could be more
Or washed up like Sonny Black's body on the seashore
That's a problem, I could be yours
A monster without the mad scientist and Igor
I've heard it before, a third of these boys
Got murder raps and never even murdered before


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block


Codename Sensei, I live what my pen say
Game hall of fame, flow is MJ, Muy caliente
Je m'appelle Rebel, capisce, comprende?
Son I'm touching 'em up, trust I'm like
Justin Tuck how they ducking the rush
Tryna Break Bad, you catch a bad break
Like I own a bake shop how I stack cakes
Greatness was nothing, Deck the next Nike ad
Wifey bad and my life got 'em slightly mad
Cause I shine like chrome in July
Soldier I opened your eyes, notice the lies
DEA say I'm drugging 'em
I get you leaning hard, I get the fiends to nod, I mean they loving 'em
All hail your highness, terrific win
Put a so-called beast in his place, Pacific Rim




Foul ass police, crooked ass friends
I don't give a fuck yo, the drama never ends
I'm a project nigga, I don't care about the Benz
Plus I had a lot of chicks, you can have those bitches
But I murder your bloodclot if you touch my riches
Yeah crazy ass skipper, I be in the slums, nigga
Fuck where I come from I'm a quiet gangster nigga
First I get you comfortable, then I start shanking niggas
Park Hill code is don't violate the family
Brother to brother it's no snakes in the amnesty
I come through wilding on some Wu-Tang 'Can It Be'
Googly-eyed nigga, chop his face in the ministry
Never scared to do the time, fuck the penitentiary
Leave a bunch of dead niggas, don't forget to mention me
The angel of rap, the un-ordinary light
Already did what I was gonna do before you even got the mic


We left a large solar cloud distinguished by size
Interaction with the wise and civilized
The mind caused matter to fall into a center
A great deal of heat that'll radiate within ya
From out of this collision
The central cord became thick enough to trap its own light and bring vision
Each drop full of Hip Hop energy
Balanced on all sides such great symmetry
The bars unlocked the power of the stars
The mirror in the telescope pinpoint the Gods
From a distance, acting as a guiding coach
Analyze the board, universal approach
Retune the soul to a certain pitch
Changing the frequency frequently, hitting a certain switch
The love is paramount, the connect is brotherly
Respect for the intellect and broad discovery



I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous a**
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your a**
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that s*** you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light


I've been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? It can't be
They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
I promise to always give you me, the real me


Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go


Owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright life'd make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumbs could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do


Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Wait until the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go




Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!


I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty range I heard that
She wanna go and party, She wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
'less I write it down for real, P.S


You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song


I really hope you play this
Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice, Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.S...




Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve
Every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking poor maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P.S.....




"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, you gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your Grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?"
"Enough with all this talkin"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you out that mother fucker homie" 

K dot, pick up the phone, nigga. Every time I call, it's going to voice mail. 
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga. 
No socks and skinny jeans and shit. Call me on Shaniqua's phone 

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo 
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo 
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo 
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo 
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce 
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies 
On the dead homies 

I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga 
My lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga 
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga 
Fuck what they talkin' bout, your shit is where its at, my nigga 
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game 
You wore no chain in this game your hood, your name in this game 
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up 
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them benjamin's go cuddle up 
Skip, hop, trip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock 
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this" 
Thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix 
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras 
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers 
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you 
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you 

Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked 
The little homies called, they said, "The enemies done cliqued up" 
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio? 
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio 
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous 
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras 
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin' 
Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer 
The streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town 
From Compton to Congress, it’s set trippin’ all around 
Ain’t nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans 
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’? 
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs 
Make it they promise to fuck with you 
No condom they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?" 

Everybody want to talk about who this and who that 
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black 
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’ 
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum 
Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit 
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since 
Don’t ask about no camera back at award shows 
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my foes 
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it 
I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button 
Had the Coast on standby 
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box” 
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide 
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets 
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats 
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay 
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game" 

I remember you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence 
Sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screaming in a hotel room 
I didn't want to self-destruct 
The evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went running for answers 
Until I came home 
But that didn't stop survivors guilt 
Going back and forth 
Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned 
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
But while my loved ones was fighting 
A continuous war back in the city 
I was entering a new one

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called "Hi! My Name Is" dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I've went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain, the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to…

I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

I know what it's like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in that trailer park?
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than make another motherfucking "We Made You", uh
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania,
So when they empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was... gone

I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way o-o-out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear

Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn’t everything

Gotta do what I gotta do


All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting, I told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question: 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two) 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question: 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
Want you look to your left and right, ask you friends 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me? 
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be? 
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime? 
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line? 
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off 
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car 
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K. Lamar 
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog 
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson 
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome 
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing 
But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question: 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And if you riding with me 

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her? 
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur? 
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt? 
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? 
Can you be immortalised without your life being expired? 
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time? 
Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent? 
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending? 
How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness? 
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended 
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing 
What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it's mentioned? 
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson 
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom 
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message 
That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And if you riding with me 

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues 
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you 
That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson 
I went to Robben's Island analysing, that's where his cell is 
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me 
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be? 
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs 
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow 
Murphy's Law, generation X, will I ever be your ex? 
Floss off a baby step, mobbed by the mouth a bit 
Pause, put me under stress 
Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect 
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall 
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead? 
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red? 
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shooter you assassin 
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it's Michael Jackson, oh 

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids? 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message 
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga 

"I remember you was conflicted 
Misusing your influence 
Sometimes I did the same 
Abusing my power, full of resentment 
Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
Found myself screaming in the hotel room 
I didn't wanna self destruct 
The evils of Lucy was all around me 
So I went running for answers 
Until I came home 
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt 
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one 
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination 
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned 
The word was respect 
Just because you wore a different gang colour than mines 
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man 
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets 
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us 
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another nigga" 

Shit and that's all I wrote 
I was gonna call another nigga but, it ain't really a poem, I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to. Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you, I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground. What you mean ‘bout that, what the ground represent? 

The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil. That's how I see it, my word is bond. I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm saying, wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you know what I'm saying it's gonna be like… there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich 

Aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that's rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities? 

I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin', I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I'm saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying. I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us 

And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? 

By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true. You know what I'm saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying, I was noticing, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it's no problem, you know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know. I'm finna go straight through 

Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? 

I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been threatened with resistance it's been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back 

Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down 

In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. And you don't wanna fight no more. And if you don't believe me you can look around, you don't see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas 

That's crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today? 

Shit, I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be bloodshed for real. I don't think America can know that. I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka. You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen 

That's crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people don't understand how important it is. Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy I'mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes 

Because the spirits, we ain't really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us 

Damn 

I wanted to read one last thing to you. It's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says: 

"The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it 
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city 
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive 
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly 
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar 
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits 
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him 
He can no longer see past his own thoughts 
He's trapped 
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city 
The result? 
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant 
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle 
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same." 

What's your perspective on that? 
Pac, Pac, Pac


You've practiced 20 years? You must be extremely good then
Perhaps, you'll try with me


Come and taste my seasonin', Chef, the cooking that is marvelous
Back over a stove, makin' your mouth water, you starve for this
Exclusive sneakers with hard denim, heavyweight
A neighbor illustrated Alex Haley with paper
Waves spinnin' like the Titanic, come take a float on
Silky like King Henry VIII’s robe in late spring
Restaurants with skeleton keys, it's big business
Well groomed and elegant posture is real dapper
Status is gigantic, culture's alpaca
Meetings in the Vatican, drinkin' scotch with the Muscle Milk
Praises go to Ason, the dynasty Mr. Russell built
Feed me royal shottas with Glocks, clean 'em with GT Oil
China dolls from Bangkok, we bang 'em, train 'em and make 'em loyal
Trees stank, she come kiss the top of my Yves Saint
Wise-Universal Tang when I bang
Grizzly with the big bank, it's 5 stars, y'all, when I call rank

 x2
Egos are somethin' that the Wu-Tang crush
These stupid jealous niggas, y'all 'bout to get rust
This ashes to ashes to dust to dust
These derelict MC's cannot fuck with us, Lord


Rifles out, bear like the Russian
Octagon tuggin' silk drawers frontin', while her head stuntin'
 flood the garage
Man the goats launchin' charge cards from Africa
Catch me in the hookah lodge
Brains linked, twisted Cohibas, say the seeds bang
Coffee pots with graveyard rings, flippin' Gs
Yankee hoodlum on the top of the charts
Dart throwers, they're sharks
Everybody wanna know when my gun barks


Non-athletic anti-semetic synthetic rappers get no credit
Pathetic septic lines, incompetent styles not embedded
Wu-Tang slang bangs in your brain, this is not genetic, prophetic
Unadulterated talent while y'all talk that bullshit rhetoric




Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down


Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre
The concept of school seems so securrre
Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well




Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe




I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering "where the ballas' at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it



Love yours
Love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive
Don't be sleepin' on your level cause its beauty in the struggle nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle nigga
(Let me explain)
It's beauty in the struggle , ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block man we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive

Whoah!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em

And check out the man he goes by the name of er...


Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smocking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swinging, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman


So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screaming _Fuck the World_ like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck!!
Talking that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck!!


I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Search to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below friezing
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snorting, supporting abortion
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an Afghan




Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screaming like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinning
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfucking style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washing dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smocking weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in




Hey, fuck that!
Outsidaz..
Pace One..
Young Zee..


Yesterday when we were getting high
you were invited, you woulda liked it
uh uh ah, I know you all too well
we said that we can kiss the past goodbye
but your weren't excited
there's no way to fight it
you can stay shawty but here I go


Should I spend the weekend in Vegas
I'm busy living the moment not taking pictures to save it
I mean how could I forget
my memories never faded I can't relate to these haters
my enemies never made it
I am... still here with who I started with
the game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr sh-t
carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship
yeah, I'm 23 with a money tree
growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist and thats how she met my pops
and now my garden is enormous, it's happening penny lane
I said its happening Penny Lane
just like you said I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead
uh ahh, thats word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough!


What am I afraid of
this is what dreams are supposed to made of
the people I don't have time to hang with
always look at me and say the same sh-t

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh



Am I wrong for making light of my situation
clap on when 40 got something for me to snap on
NOw that I'm on I dont want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on
get my f-cking buffett on
I heard they jsut moved my grandmother to a nursing home
and I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
but hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
that I barely know at all and
plus this women that I mess with unprotected txt us saying she wish she woulda kept it
the one I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
I couldn't tell you where the f-ck head is
I'm holding on by a thread its like I'm high right now
the guy right now and you can tell by looking at my eyes right now
that nothing really comes as a surprise right now
cause we having the time of our lives right now




I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
the other day Lissa told me she missed the old me
which made me question when I went missing
and when I start treating my friends different
maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the 2 guns in my face during the stick up
maybe cause I girl I f-cking trusted set the whole sh-t up
but a fact I have'nt seen 'em since they locked big Rich up
I know, the same time, I'm quick to forget
bout to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets
burn it al burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
cause half the itme I got it right I probably guessed
did I just trade free time for camera time
will I blow all of this money baby, hammertime
yeah, I just need some closure, aint no turning back for me
I'm in it till it's over

   
Turn my headphones up

Your walkin down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the mornin
And your in a
Nightmare
It's HORRIBLE
Right there's the coroner
Waitin for you
To turn the corner
So he can corner ya
Your a goner
He's ona ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
Cause you can't run anymore
Your done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody
Is watchin in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplading my next plot again
Swallowin the Klonopin
While I'm noddin
In and out on the autumn and
If the ramada inn
Holdin onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at mcdonalds
With
Blood all over me
Dead bodies
Behind the counter
SHIT
Guess I must of just blacked out again
NOT AGAIN

It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and

( 2)
Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel
Until I find hannah montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin
Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin
Every candle on top of the fire place
Mantalin
Grab my flannel and my bandana then
Kiss the naked manakin man again
You can see him standin in my
Front window
If you look in
I'm just a hooligan
Who's use to usin hallicinogens
Causin illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Raise the scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules too
Me
What am I gone do
Had the prodical son
The diabolical one
Very methodical
I slaughtered them

()
It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I duck and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I
Had that much fun
Off a half pint of the jack
My last vic and a half
A flashlight
Up kim kardashians ass

I remember the first time
I dismembered a family member
December I think it was
I was having drinks with my cuz
And I wrapped him
In christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin tub
Cut him up into pieces
Then just when I went to drink his
Blood
I thought I outta drink this bath water
That outta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me
That might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams
Just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 am
And here I come
So you should probably run
A secret passage way around here
Man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs
It aint no stoppin me from choppin him up(up)

Cause it's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and

To a woman so heartless (ya-a-a)
How could you be so heartless?(y-a-a)Oh
How could you be so heartless?

Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo

I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo I know some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo I did some things but that's the old me

So you walk around like you don't know me

Homie I don't know 
She's hot and cold

'Cause I already know how this thing goes
You run and tell your friends that your leavin' me 
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see

In the night I hear `em talk
The coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless(ya-a-a)

Talkin', talkin', talkin' talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we've been through 
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I've got something new to see
And you just keep on hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
 I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong?
And you can`t make it right 
I'm gon' take off tonight 
Into the night

I hear `em talk
The coldest story  ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless(ya-a-a)
How could you be so heartless?Oh

Don’t let me into my zone 


I’m definitely in my zone

Rrrr Ting

I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy, get hurt, boy
Aww, here go another mo'fucker that don't understand
The concept of puttin' money first, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You too worried 'bout the bitches
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it
She'll admit it, she'll admit it
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy
Shit hot up in the 6 right now, shit hot up in the 6, boy

Coming from the motherfucking 6 side

Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this
I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now




We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!


Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here


Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth
Cuz the people that hurt can’t understand it
You speakin outlandish, I’m ashamed how to make it all work
Another planet, it’s a short term role for me
I rec it’s all for me, it’s just mo with me
And you’re here for you too here can re-persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin off, I ain’t takin off these pistons
I’m takin off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much it’d cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a shortterm goal, no sky is the limit
I’m past that, now pass that
A word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours


I see myself performing at
Soldout shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammys, winning 5 awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Can’t imagine how it feels
That’s why I’m smiling every day
Cause my dream ain’t far away


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


You’re looking at me and tell me I’m blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I’m at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, I’m reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I’m a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow I’mma take that I’ll never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I root
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin to you, I was walkin it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello


And I’m so happy I cry
Cause I can’t believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it’s so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you play so hard
And you’ve come so far
And you go, that is the time for you to leave your more
And I’m gonna do it
Watch me


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better

But now I see my nigga

Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps
Fuck being timid in the Civic

Fuck with me my nigga

Stand back and watch if you want to nigga

Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you nigga

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?

Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Father forgive me for me, childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me, miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but
Before you go I've got to, warn you now
Whatever goes up surely, must come down
And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command

You know what I'm trying to do
Hey, let's pop the E off at Liv

I get her hot like Wasabi
She think it's wavy and gnarly
I think I'mma pop one for you
Drink one for you

Still in Miami
Most of these girls are too messy
I've got to do some reflecting
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction
I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like brrrrr

I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight
PND ain't with the ray tay, you know Jay Wray

But I aint blowin this one
Naah man haha

Cinderella Man (x4)

Who can catch lighting in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin out the nozzle on a fire hose, cry it and swallow

Cinderella Man (x4)

Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, takes his hands and cup em
Spin around to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff em

Cinderella Man (x4)


There's a storm comin that the weatherman couldn't predict
I've start to ball prick you better flea cuz I get ticked
it's a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch ya to the ground ya trick
It's a trap, fuck my last CD that shit's in my trash
I'll be God damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in a blink of an eye, so betcha I'll last
So keep winkin and blowin kisses cuz ur flirtin with death
I'm destroyin ur livelihood, I ain't just hurtin ur rep
I catch a flow and get goin,
No remorse, I'm showin they slowin, for no one, knowin there is nothing you can do about it
Zeroin in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I'll shut your lane down, if you can spot the parked in at 2
Arsenic flower, lighter fluid, saliva, what can you do
lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com
Go get ur crew, hype you up, stand behind you like "woooooooo"
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how bout you?
Now guess who....(Hey)
Here's a clue....(Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
Now, what's his name

Cinderella Man (x4)


If I had a time machine
I'd be...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Music is my time machine
So call me...

Cinderella Man (x4)


Fuck catchin lighting, he struck it
Screamed shut up at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward

Cinderella Man (x4)

Rewound the future to the present
Paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker he's the shit right now
he's...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Cinderella man sent to fell Shady dey
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell from hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with this Cinderella story,
nor did he come to do the same, or can't afford to be a lamo in this day and age
And at this stage in the game, mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old H-I to the new Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah
The coupe de gras, raise em high, in the sky
People are tryin to bring this place alive
Thanks for bein patient I will make no more mistakes,
shit my Potatoes baked homie the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin weed, yea faggot the stakes are high
Shit I ain't even supposed to be here by the grace of God
By the skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts I skated by
Now ya'll are on in ice with ankle weights I hate to lie
Now how fuckin irritated are you, how much in ur face am I
And there ain't shit you can do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and I'm a spittin image I mirror it
When I stand near it, ur pussy lyric I couldn't hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
Who? (Hey)
Here's a clue (Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater and lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
now...what's his name




Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go maybe I'll stay
Maybe I'll stay
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go

He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's about to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood

Ay from the dark I showed you my scars and I told you girl, I won't lie
If we at war, then this is a war that I can't afford (No I, I, I)
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I...I.. cry
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile
Lately
It's been hard for me to smile
It's been hard for me to smile
It's been hard for me to smile

If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home

He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's about to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood



Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black, white or a albino yeah
You can have corn rows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go *blah
From outta nowhere, you might find your career
Come to an *err and I'm just like (Oh Yeah)

Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let em talk shit, cause they talk shit
Knowing deep down, they really just wanna squash it
Cause no one wants to walk around, stepping in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum'
We just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm
Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiya'
Meanwhile your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
Right in the ass with KY, yes sir!
So full of joy, boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you
'Yea boi don't curr'



See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)

And where is G-Unit at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)



Ya homie got clapped on, man I don't care
The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is dogg, man life's not fair
Ya friend should've know not to front round here
Listen kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear
They'll strip yo ass of your jewels, right here
Man I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
Ya girl's a freak, man sometime we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You prolly heard about me, I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin, like I'm running for mayor
riding, winding, dining and shining, know what I'm saying
I ain't got time for fucking around, and horseplaying
I'm making hits, my homies taking hits, who's staying



See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
Last name ever 
First name greatest 
Like a sprained ankle boy ainâ€™t nothing to play with 
It started off local but thanks to all the haters 
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis 
And your city faded off to brown, Nino 
She insists she got more class, we know 
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo 
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo 
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album 
Whoâ€™d have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome 
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm 
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one 
Yeah nigga Iâ€™m about my business 
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list 
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness 
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness 
Bitches 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
I used to have hood dreams 
Big fame, big chains 
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came 
I went hard all fall like the ball teams 
Just so I can make it rain all spring 
Yâ€™all seen my story my glory 
I had raped the game young 
You can call it statutory 
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me 
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin 
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin 
You would think I ran the world like Michelleâ€™s husband 
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnâ€™t 
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnâ€™t 
Youâ€™re such a fucking loser 
He didnâ€™t even go to class Bueller 
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back 
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack 
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac 
All the way in Hollywood and I canâ€™t even act 
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap 
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
Ok, hello it's da Martian 
Space jam Jordanâ€™s 
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden 
Fresher than the harvest 
Step up to the target 
If I had one guess than I guess Iâ€™m just New Orleans 
And I will never stop like Iâ€™m running from the cops 
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top 
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops 
But what should I scream for this is my theme park 
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark 
Pistol on my side you donâ€™t wanna hear that thing talk 
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention 
Lil Wayne thatâ€™s what they got to say or mention 
Iâ€™m like Nevada in the middle of the summer 
Iâ€™m resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover 
Shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas 
No brake pads, no such thing as last 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man 

 
There they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow 
Nuts they go, macadamia they go so ballistic, whoa 
We can make them look like Bosoâ€™s 
Heâ€™s wondering if he should spit this slow 
Fuck no! Go for broke 
His cup just runneth over, oh no 
He ainâ€™t had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed 
Theyâ€™ve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose 
Back into the game and they know 
Rap will never be the same as before 
Bashing in the brains of these hoes 
And establishing a name as he goes 
The passion and the flame is ignited 
You canâ€™t put it out once we light it 
This shit is exactly what the fuck that Iâ€™m talking about when we riot 
You dealinâ€™ with a few true villains 
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillinâ€™ 
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths 
Now rewind it! 
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me, so howâ€™s it taste? 
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place 
Iâ€™m Hannibal Lecter so just in case youâ€™re thinking of saving face 
You ainâ€™t gonna have no face to save by the time Iâ€™m through with this place 
So Drakeâ€¦ 

 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man

Boi-1da, what's poppin'?

Yeah, yeah
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari then I swerve
I want that Bugatti just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me I guess I know myself
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that
My city too turnt up I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbraud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
That's when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man I'm talkin' way before hashtags

I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go

Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up in here got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie
Yeah, and you know how that shit go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go

She know it, it a no big
Always haffi look out an ya know if yuh head buk out
Dun know, a de unruly boss, dis man

With no apology, If you nuh like we, we nuh like you neither youth
Your girl a say we cute, if you diss you will get execute
That's the truth, OVO unruly

(machine gun shots)

With my woes

Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who"
And she like, "who are we kidding? You're 27, you just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me ,momma
What more they want from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough
Ir making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life


Fraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make believe, rapping 'bout my own life
Real names kill things, that's that shit I won't write
Cause my niggas still selling dope like they ain't on their third strikes
Camping out in that corridor, fuck you waiting on Jordans for?
I middle-man it for 23, just meet me somewhere around Baltimore
(Woo!) That's rare nigga, (Woo!) Ric Flair nigga
(Woo!) The power's in my hair nigga, (Woo!) I give this beat the chair nigga
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes: trifecta
Dope money, hope money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit – ungrateful niggas, I don't like


A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like


(This Chicago, nigga!)
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathing like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eating good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissing girls, cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hanging out that window it's about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? right?!




(Young Chop on the beat)
Fake Gucci, that's that shit I don't like
Smoking on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screaming Sosa, that's that nigga that I like
I don't want relations, I just want one night
Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes, cause I'm living life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealing light
Bitch I'm high off life, got me feeling right
Bitch I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like
And bitch we GBE, we just go on sight




We are not one and the same, nigga I'm fucking insane, fuck is you saying?
Yo ass been doing the same, shit, not doing what you saying
Dang, I told yo old bitch she was fucking a lame, turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holding that pain, I just hope you been praying
Bang bang, riding for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlifes
And I run this bitch like it's no lights, going hard the whole night
Cause I ain't going back to my old life, I promise




I done sold purple, I done sold white
Running outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowing up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas

Wake up Mr. West 



Uh, Yeah, Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah



And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way,
So this is in the name of love, like Robert says
Before you ask me to get a job today, can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS,
So I guess we just pray like the minister say,
Allah o Akbar and throw em some hot cars,
Things we see on the screen are not ours,
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far,
Where im from, the dope boys is the rock stars,
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars,
I guess they want us all behind bars.
I know it.


Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)


They say people in your life are seasons,
And anything that happen is for a reason,
And niggas guns a clappin and keep to squeezin',
And Gran (Grandma) keep prayin' and keep believin',
And Jesus and one day that ya see him,
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him,
The devil is alive I feel him breathin',
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin',
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us,
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down,
Now my lil cousin smokin those cigarettes now,
His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now,
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out...
Im Stickin around....


Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

(Cuz every worthless word we get more far away, and nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today


Look, homicide is illegal, death is a penalty
Never let go when you've got ahold of your enemy
Eagle claw cobra clutch by any means necessary
I’ll never let it go, see my shadow ninja mic flow
I throw a great entre dart arrow to your temple
Allmighty  to the insidious
Plan of the Wu-Tang Clan became a world brand
We never let it go, we talk a half a mil a show


Never let go of your mind
It’s a terrible thing to waste
To lose, but it’s very hard to find
Being that ignorance is lethal
We must touch hearts, tune souls, harmonize the people
Never let go of your plan, execute
So when you shoot, inspire everyone on the land
Never lose knowledge of yourself
For it may become risk to your health
And great loss of wealth


Never let go of your cream, never let go of your dream
Players retire, but they never let go of the team
If you a rider then you never let go of that thing
Pull up your mans’ like you better let go of that bling
This life’s crazy, too many life sentences, maybe
Fatherless babies on the block but they father 380
That’s just the hood lately, never let go
I’m what the hood made me
Momma told me to find a good lady


Never let go of staring at the death
Like yo, that's your best blow
I still hold on like En Vogue
The cold go to war with the heat
Eyes wide, never falling asleep
All the talking is cheap
Call'em, ultimate warrior, W.W.F
I come up victorious, struggle is nothing to Deck
Set it straight for the seeds, to see a better new
Take the real life by the rings and I ain’t letting go
I ain’t letting go


No matter what the odds be
No matter how hard we
You never let go


Never let go of the fight, never let go of the mic
My honesty, my values, my loyalty, my pride
And memory of those who have passed to the other side
Never letting go, I’m never letting go of my beliefs
My faith, convictions, real
Both hands holding on, never let go the wheel
We hood legends, misunderstood
These lessons, learned
Growing up for manhood
Keep focus on the prize what you better do
A little taste of heaven, sunshine is where we headed to
States what’s ahead of you, always on the schedule
Smoke the gold leaf down to the residue
Letting go, is something that I never do
Those who let go, live life regrettable
Never let go of your hope or your rope
Eyes on the prize, never let go of the scope
When I’m in jail, never let go of the soap
Hold on, boy, never let go


Never let go, the all-eye-seeing, the supreme
Never let go the love of your seeds, or your queen
Never let go your heart, or the place you started
The feeling that I had, Wu-Tang had just charted
The old earth departed, I give thanks to the martyrs
I never let go the love I have for thy father
Never let go the glow
The more I know the more that it shows
I won’t let go, even if I decompose
Your seed will carry it on, we need to carry it on
Pass the baton, life is just the marathon
And ain't' playing to win it, it’s an epidemic
Never let go, that’s what the god recommended




And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. Who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom

When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)


I know way too many people here right now that I didn’t know last year
who the fuck are y’all
I swear it feels like the last few nights we’ve been everywhere and back
but I just can’t remember it all
what am I doing, what am I doing
oh yeah that's right, I’m doing me, I’m doing me
I’m living life right now man
and this what I’m do til its over
til it’s over, it’s far from over


alright, bottles on me
long as I’m a drink it
never drop the ball, fuck y’all thinking
making sure the young money ship is never sinking
bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldn’t have drove, tell me how I’m getting home
you too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I’ve ever known
got to go thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
all I need is a fucking red jackets with some zippers
super good smiddoke a package of the swishas
I did it over night, it couldn’t happen any quicker
y’all know them, but fuck it me either
but point the biggest skeptic out I’ll make them a believer
it wouldn’t be the first time I’ve done it throwing hundreds
when I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ahh,




Uhhh,
one thing 'bout music when it hits you feel no pain
and I swear I got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
so they tell me that they love me I know better than that it’s just game
it’s just what comes with the flame
and I’m ready for that I’m just saying
but I really can’t complain, everything is kosher
two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
I really can’t see the end getting any closer
but I’ll probably still be the man when everything is over
so I’m riding through the city with my high beams on
can you see me can you see me get your visine on
y’all just do not fit the picture
turn your widespread on
if you thinking Imma quit before I die dream on
man they treat me like a legend
am I really this cold
I’m really too young to be felling this old
it’s about time you admit it who you kidding man
nobody’s ever done it like I did it
ahh
(chorus)

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And I think it's changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture, the trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagle's, an Aries coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
(Real talk) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ride around his block
All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
Welcome to Detroit, mothafucka

Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D
On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas say
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
And to think y'all hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
I had K's in front ya school, but I ain't go to Kettering
Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son
And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody

Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit

And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me
I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch
180 degrees in here trying to wait for the cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah when it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
Sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it
It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters when you came here?
And I came to kill 'em

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

What up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody
Hey Em let me get that instrumental
Take it down to the hood
Let the little hoodies get this remix crackin'
Detroit

Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me girl why you be stressin me for time
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cuz niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me girl why you be stressin me for time
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

My inhibitions, fighting my intuition
Premature premonition
Showin me the demoliton of these phony niggas
So ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime
And checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me! BLAOOOW

Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me girl why you be stressin me for time
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a King
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

Listen
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem, and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gone snatch the crown
Look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds, one verse at a time
And claim too sick. And fuck it, if the shoe fits
Who's the king?

We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
But in reality he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize
The fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same
Are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
Cause deep down I know every poet just wanna be loved

Just the two of us.. 


Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. 
Just you and I!

Just the two of us..

Its what you all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for damn it
They cant stand it, they want something new
So let's get re-acquainted
Became the hood favorite
I cant even explain it
I surprise myself too

Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on, with something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, here's another hit, Barry Bonds


(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
We outta here baby!
We outta here baby!
We outta here baby!


Dude!
Fresh off the plane, konitchiwa bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
As for what I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it and he lived it, spitted then he shitted
I don't need to write hits, I might bounce ideas,
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
Ive been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
They said he's going crazy and we seen this before
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no low-head
Cos my Dior got me more model head
I'm insulted
You should go head
And bow so hard till your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MC's you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MC's you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you can get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on, with something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, here's another hit, Barry Bonds


(Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Yeah, Yeah, We outta here baby!
Wha, Wha, We outta here baby!
And Mr. West is so outta here baby
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby


I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my eyes so wight like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I’m so fucking good like I’m sleeping with Megan
I’m all about my franklins, Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops I meant have them, I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies
Its such a hayvic, oops I meant havoc
And my drink's still pinker than the easter rabbit
And I'm still cold (cole) like Keisha's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it cos I'm so at it
I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice
and I don't lack shit
And you can get Barried
Suck my bat bitch


We outta here baby
We outta here baby
We outta here baby


Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on
Wit something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, man here's another hit, Barry Bonds

(yeah yeah yeah yeah)



I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
I faced her around
But his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His bridges, he out grow'd em


Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand,
Someone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm, you prick
You call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder
You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me
See he's in a whole nother weight class
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets
You're full of it; you were just in his CD's
Left at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E

I'm haunted I'm dead your gone

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oooooh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it 

Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do


All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting, I told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

 

Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
Some shit about a message you left 
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" 
This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! 
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre 
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way) 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch 

So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
We can fly over the border "Let's go" 
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
 (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri 
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste 
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Plus he raps with his regular voice 
 (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys 
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ 
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! 
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
Do somethin'! At least one punchline 
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs 
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither 
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!) 
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 


Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', ain't no tellin'

Suitcase, I been livin' out a suitcase
Still drinkin' Henny, if it's done, I'll take the D'usse
Oops, aye, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
True say, I been goin' hard, but then again
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in, man
I got a blunt, can I get a light?
Yeah, I took the summer off to get it right
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Niggas like "you took the summer off? we couldn't tell"
Dawg, just bought a island, gotta sail to it
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it somebody gotta do it
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it

Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
The shit was gettin' too predictable
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah
I mean we hear about the money you been gettin'
We just never seen a visual
It's our year (aw yeah), Aw yeah
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)
What's the word these days?
Buncha' niggas chasing after all these woman they don't even know (WOOO)
Buncha' out of season woman
Fuckin' off-season niggas to get last season wardrobe (WOOO)
All the rappers that you vouch for
Need to get out of the house more, they washed up
And even if the team was religious with it
I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, naw (WOOO)

OVO, Unruly
One shot to make it in a life
From the six to the fucking 876

I gotta keep watchin' for oppers 'case anything's possible, yeah
There's no code or ethics out here, anyone will take shots at you, yeah
Niggas think they can come take what I got, let's be logical, yeah
V-Live, I order that Alfredo pasta then eat in the kitchen like i'm in the mafia
Houston, they get me though
European, my vehicle
How much it hit me fo'?
Ain't no tellin', yeah
What am I willin' to give her to get what I want tonight?
Ain't no tellin'
Please don't speak to me like I'm that Drake from four years ago
I'm at a higher place
Thinkin' they lions and tigers and bears, I go huntin'
Put heads on my fire place, oh my
Take time, ain't no tellin'
Oh my, ain't no tellin'

The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
And turned to the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossin' the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts and get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights, cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me cause I love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide
It's just physics, please let's put our egos aside
You my niggas, and should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said son
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track

Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God
Nigga Cole the God
January 28th 


How did I end up right here with you
after all the things that I been through
its been one of those days
you tryin’ forget about
take a shot and let it out
let’s get right
now that I’m here baby...


show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
show me a good
show me a good
show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)


I live for the nights that I can’t remember,
with the people that I won’t forget
spending all the money I just work my ass off
for the things that I won’t regret
I’ve been waiting way too long long long long
tellin’ everybody that I know we about to be on on on on
I ain’t tryin’ look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with
that’s my team, never would I let a woman come between
what we doing right now
this our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream
I’m the Osirus of the shit right now
go to guy for the hits right now
whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now
if you can’t hold your liquor you better quit right now





How ’bout you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed
make the most out of tonight and worry bout it all tomorrow
understand girl, we fam girl
can’t get me right and I do Wayne
Cash money young money pop champagne
Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
people really hate when a backpack rapper get rich
and start livin’ that life dawg
feels like when you gettin’ to that paper hip hop hates ya
they would do it just like I do if they could
its in our nature
ahh, young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer
I came up in the underground though
so I’ma spend another ten thousand for Dilla
call me over rated or creative or too jaded
because any way you put it bitch I made it, YUP




Attention all units, attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
He could be coming at your girlfriend next


There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him unmercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!


Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone


Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!

I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got sh*t on what you're feeling now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man
Yeah I said it, B*tch I'm the man
Don't you forget it

The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in the speaker right now: that's me
And the voice in the mirror, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted, with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason that you always getting faded

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me

Ok look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things

It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of "Mr Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me


May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you
And heaven accept you..

{verse 1}
all niqht i've, been starin'
can you tell i want you ?
can't be too, wide open
but there's nothin, i won't do
ohhh... just want  you to know

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

{verse 2}
I wish i... wasn't famous
I wish i... was still in school
So that i can have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you crazy

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh 
See I just want what i can't have 
Wont even give a chance 
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious


{fadey fade away.... lls .}

I'm me bitch, I said I'm me bitch

Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG




Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love,
Cause I don't have the time for that
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where it's at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract

I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggaz for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch

And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG




I a'int have sex in a long time 
Are we havin is sex tonight?
Ladies say, I ain't have sex in a long time
I a'int have sex in a long ass time
Baby, I ain't have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight, sex tonight

Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100 nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'

Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

 Hailie
 What??
 Come here baby
Bring daddy his Oscar
 Okay
 We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass



I'm about to get rid of some hoes it's simple
I put the Murder Inc with lead and I'm not talking about a pencil
Look at what the fuck you dun got into
I see you found your nitch you're just a bitch with a menstral
Claiming you a murderer and spelt it wrong
You put the "E" before the "D" because that's all you on
You on Pac's dick (bitch) you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins 3 deals that another nigga got you they didn't see
skills
And I ain't playing your a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be praying on his cover cause he need it
And you niggas hating shut your mouths
It's just the real niggas ain't buying that shit you put out


Doe Rae Me but we don't sing motherfuckers
So Murder Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team who expects nothing less then R 'n' B coming from that regime
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream
Now that you embrace the green don't fuck with the triple beams
You're a motherfucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen?
Artists with repituares saw him in action, Pac's assassination
Def jam grabbed him, told him reenact him you'll go platinum
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins
Reenacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in Detroit motherfucker


Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da
Don't play me cause your washed up, lost your spot
Mama say mama sa Macosaca
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
Doe Rae Me cause we're hot and you're not
Going at me is the only shot you got
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
You can get popped after all that shit you talk


Now we can skip past the mean mugs, get to the slugs
To grievance and the crying and intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga you shook,
You're half of a half-way crook nigga get off X dick go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one and when your gone you'll only be the late fake
one
Nigga please stick the script before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch, fucking old ass ignorant innocent looking senior citizen
Built up slap you like renaissance sicitive wait a minute hold on
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch made man now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holla and curse and go ahead and respond
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse


Slim set an impulse to get at the wanktas
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the drama for stucky and bush stones
What's wrong? didn't think were strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
This real witness you all ain't caught the concept
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source
Threatening at the boss you're gonna see me on your porch
Now I've got the nerve to try serve on us
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust


Do I gotta get my nigga bugs, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Caddillac, Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat
You not Pac's songs without laws will help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your "mock"avelli get your own identity


Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da
(Don't EVER say my little girls name in a song again)
Don't play me cause you're washed up, lost your spot
Mama say mama sa Macosaca
(Fucking punk pussy, BITCH!)
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
Doe Rae Me cause we're hot and you're not
(I'm gonna fuck you up boy)
Going at me is the only shot you got
(Never again in your mother fucking life)
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
(Gonna shoot the shit outta you little fucking midgets,
Hailie will whip your mother fucking asses)
You can get popped after all that shit you talk

Give money to all my real niggas
Obie Trice, D12, G-Unit, 50 Cent, Hailie Jade Hahahaha

 Daddy is Ja Rule taller than me?

 No honey you guys are the same size

I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous a**
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your a**
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that s*** you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light


Fuck dat
8 doobies to the face
Fuck dat
12 bottles in the case
Nigga, fuck dat
2 pills and a half, wait
Nigga, fuck dat
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist


Man, I swear
My nigga trippin off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him vicodin
Hope to take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of section 8
And you feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are
A loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins
Make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin off
My generation sippin cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition
That the world is bout to end
Who gives a fuck? we never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
A melody and some hoes
Playstation and some drank
Technology bumping Soul
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd, that's product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black
She black too
Purple label on her back
But that dap
Is like when she take it straight to the head
Then she look at me
She got AD-HD




Like woah oh oh woah (x4)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(They always told me ad-hd did it)


And then she started
And then she started
Feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
Beg you pardon
Oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23
Ok then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said where my drink at?
I'mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors
Have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds
Closed the screen, jumbotron
Made it to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it
Then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That ADHD crazy






You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six
Just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, dro, hoes
Whatever you like
You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light
